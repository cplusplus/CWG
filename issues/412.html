Can a replacement allocation function be inline?

<P>A customer reports that when he attempts to replace
<TT>::operator new</TT> with
a user-defined function, the standard library calls the default
function by preference if the user-defined function is inline.  I
believe that our compiler is correct, and that such a replacement
function isn't allowed to be inline, but I'm not sure there's
sufficiently explicit language in the standard.</P>

<P>In general, of course, the definition of an inline function must be
present in every translation unit where the function is called.
(9.2.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct.spec">dcl.fct.spec</A>],
par 4)  It could be argued that this requirement doesn't quite address
replacement functions: what we're dealing with is the odd case where
we've already got one definition and the user is supplying a different
one.  I'd like to see something specifically addressing the case of a
replacement function.</P>

<P>So what do we have?  I see discussion of requirement for a replacement
<TT>::operator new</TT> in three places:
16.4.5.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/replacement.functions">replacement.functions</A>],
17.6.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/new.delete.single">new.delete.single</A>] par 2, and
6.7.6.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.dynamic">basic.stc.dynamic</A>] par
2-3.  I don't see anything explicitly saying that the replacement
function may not be inline.  The closest I can find is
17.6.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/new.delete.single">new.delete.single</A>] par 2,
which says that "a C++ program may define a function with this function
signature that displaces the default version defined by the C++
Standard library".  One might argue that "with this function signature"
rules out inline, but that strikes me as a slight stretch.</P>

<P>Have I missed anything?</P>

<P>
<U>Andrew Koenig</U>:
I think you've turned up a problem in
9.2.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct.spec#4">dcl.fct.spec</A>] paragraph 4.  Consider:</P>
<PRE>
  // Translation unit 1
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;

  extern void foo(void (*)());

  inline void bar() {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, world!" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  }

  int main() {
    foo(bar);
  }

  // Translation unit 2
  void foo(void (*f)()) { (*f)(); }
</PRE>

<P>Are you really trying to tell me that this program is ill-formed because
the definition of bar is not available in translation unit 2?</P>

<P>I think not.  The actual words in
9.2.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct.spec">dcl.fct.spec</A>] par 4 are
<BLOCKQUOTE>
An inline function shall be defined in every translation unit in
which it is used...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
and I think at in this context, ``used'' should be interpreted to mean
that foo is used only in translation unit 1, where it is converted to
a value of type void(*)().</P>

<P><B>Notes from October 2003 meeting:</B></P>

<P>We don't think Andy Koenig's comment requires any action;
"used" is already defined appropriately.</P>

<P>We agree that this replacement should not be allowed, but
we think it's a library issue (in the rules for allowed
replacements).  Forwarded to library group; it's issue 404
on the library issues list.</P>
