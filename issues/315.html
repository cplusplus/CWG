Is call of static member function through null pointer undefined?

<B>Section: </B>11.4.9.2&#160; [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.static.mfct">class.static.mfct</A>]

<P>Another instance to consider is that of invoking a member function from a
null pointer:</P>
<PRE>
  struct A { void f () { } };
  int main ()
  {
    A* ap = 0;
    ap-&gt;f ();
  }
</PRE>
<P>Which is explicitly noted as undefined in 11.4.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mfct.non.static">class.mfct.non.static</A>],
even though one could argue that since <TT>f()</TT> is empty, there is no
lvalue-&gt;rvalue conversion.</P>

<P>If <TT>f</TT> is static, however, there seems to be no such rule, and
the call is only undefined if the dereference implicit in the <TT>-&gt;</TT>
operator is undefined.  IMO it should be.</P>

<P>Incidentally, another thing that ought to be cleaned up is the inconsistent
use of "indirection" and "dereference".  We should pick one. <I>(This
terminology issue has been broken out as
<A HREF="342.html">issue 342</A>.)</I>
</P>

<P>This is related to <A HREF="232.html">issue 232</A>.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (October 2003):</B></P>

<P>We agreed the example should be allowed.  <TT>p-&gt;f()</TT>
is rewritten as <TT>(*p).f()</TT> according to 7.6.1.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.ref">expr.ref</A>].
<TT>*p</TT> is not an error when <TT>p</TT> is null unless the
lvalue is converted to an rvalue (7.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.lval">conv.lval</A>]), which it
isn't here.</P>

<P><B>Additional notes (June, 2024)</B></P>

<P>
<A HREF="2823.html">Issue 2823</A> represents the current
language rules; the example has undefined behavior.</P>
