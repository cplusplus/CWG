<P>According to 14.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/except.ctor#2">except.ctor</A>] paragraph 2,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

An object that is partially constructed or partially
destroyed will have destructors executed for all of its
fully constructed base classes and non-variant members, that
is, for subobjects for which the principal constructor
(11.9.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.base.init">class.base.init</A>]) has completed execution and
the destructor has not yet begun execution.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This wording leaves unclear whether the remaining
elements of an array will be destroyed if the destructor for
one of the elements exits via an exception: an array element
is a subobject (6.7.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.object#2">intro.object</A>] paragraph 2), but
it is not a base class or non-variant member.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (September, 2010):</B></P>

<P>Change 14.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/except.ctor#2">except.ctor</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

An object <DEL>that is partially constructed or partially
destroyed</DEL> <INS> of any storage duration whose initialization or
destruction is terminated by an exception</INS> will have destructors
executed for all of its fully constructed <DEL>base classes and
non-variant members</DEL> <INS>subobjects (excluding the variant
members of a union-like class)</INS>, that is, for subobjects for
which the principal constructor (11.9.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.base.init">class.base.init</A>]) has
completed execution and the destructor has not yet begun execution.
Similarly, if the non-delegating constructor...
