<P>Consider:</P>

<PRE>
  inline auto lambda = []{}; //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> same in different translation units or not?</SPAN>
</PRE>

<P>This can be observed, for example, through the following variable
template:</P>

<PRE>
  template&lt;class T&gt; int v;
</PRE>

<P>Is <TT>&amp;v&lt;decltype(lambda)&gt;</TT> the same address in every
translation unit?</P>

<P><U>Possible resolution:</U></P>

<OL>
<LI>
<P>Change in 6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr#14">basic.def.odr</A>] paragraph 14 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

For any definable item D with definitions in multiple translation
units,
<UL>
<LI>if D is a non-inline non-templated function or variable, or</LI>
<LI>if the definitions in different translation units do not satisfy
the following requirements,</LI>
</UL>
the program is ill-formed; a diagnostic is required only if the
definable item is attached to a named module and a prior definition is
reachable at the point where a later definition occurs. Given such an
item, for all definitions of D, or, if D is an unnamed enumeration,
for all definitions of D that are reachable at any given program
point, the following requirements shall be satisfied<INS>, where the
definition of a closure type is considered to consist of the sequence
of tokens of the corresponding <I>lambda-expression</I></INS>.

<UL>
<LI>...</LI>
<LI>Each such definition shall consist of the same sequence of
tokens<DEL>, where the definition of a closure type is considered to
consist of the sequence of tokens of the
corresponding <I>lambda-expression</I></DEL>.</LI>
<LI>...</LI>
</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>Add another example after example 6, immediately before
6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr#18">basic.def.odr</A>] paragraph 18:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE class="ins">

[ Example:
<PRE>
  inline decltype([]{}) v1;
  inline auto v2 = []{};
</PRE>
If the definition of <TT>v1</TT> appears in multiple translation
units, the program is ill-formed, no diagnostic required, because each
definition declares <TT>v1</TT> to have a different type. If the
definition of <TT>v2</TT> appears in multiple translation units, the
behavior of the program is as if there is only one definition, and
only a definition can supply an initializer; therefore the behavior is
as if there is only one initializer. Therefore, <TT>v2</TT> has the
same type in every translation unit.  -- end example]

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If, at any point in the program, there is more than one reachable
unnamed enumeration definition in the same scope...</P>
