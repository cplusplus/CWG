<P>[Accepted as a DR at the November, 2024 meeting.]</P>



<P>Subclause 11.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.local#3">class.local</A>] paragraph 3 establishes
restrictions on the definition of classes nested within local classes,
but it is unclear which restrictions exist for other members of local
classes.</P>

<P><U>Possible resolution [SUPERSEDED]:</U></P>

<P>Change in 11.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.local#3">class.local</A>] paragraph 3 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<DEL>If class X is a local class, a nested class Y may be
declared in class X and later defined in the
definition of class X or be later defined in the same scope as the
definition of class X.</DEL> A class nested within a local class is a local
class.
<INS>A member of a local class X shall be declared only in the
definition of X or the nearest enclosing block scope of X.</INS>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>CWG 2024-06-14</B></P>

<P>The implementation status quo is that no members of local classes
other than nested classes can be defined at block scope.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (approved by CWG 2024-11-08):</B></P>

<P>Change in 11.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.local#3">class.local</A>] paragraph 3 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<DEL>If class X is a local class, a nested class Y may be
declared in class X and later defined in the
definition of class X or be later defined in the same scope as the
definition of class X.</DEL> A class nested within a local class is a local
class.
<INS>A member of a local class X shall be declared only in the
definition of X or, if the member is a nested class, in the nearest
enclosing block scope of X.</INS>
