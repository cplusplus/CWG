Class/enumeration names vs conditions

<P>According to Clause 8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/stmt.stmt#3">stmt.stmt</A>] paragraph 3,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A name introduced by a declaration in a <I>condition</I> (either introduced
by the <I>decl-specifier-seq</I> or the <I>declarator</I> of the condition)
is in scope from its point of declaration until the end of the
substatements controlled by the condition. If the name is redeclared in the
outermost block of a substatement controlled by the condition, the
declaration that redeclares the name is ill-formed.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This does not exempt class and enumeration names, which can ordinarily
coexist with non-type names in the same scope (_N4868_.6.4.10 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.scope.hiding#2">basic.scope.hiding</A>] paragraph 2)
. However, there is implementation variance in the handling
of examples like:</P>

<PRE>
   void g() {
     if (int N = 3) {
       struct N { } n; //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> ill-formed but not diagnosed by some implementations</SPAN>
     }
   }

</PRE>

<P>Should the rule for <I>condition</I>s be updated to allow for this
case?</P>

<P><B>Rationale (April, 2018):</B></P>

<P>Hiding of tag names by non-type names was added for C compatibility.
C does not support conditions, and there was no consensus to extend the
tag/non-type hiding rules into contexts where C compatibility is not
required.</P>
