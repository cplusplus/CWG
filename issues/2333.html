<P>[Accepted at the November, 2020 meeting as part of paper P2029R4.]</P>

<P>The meaning of a numeric escape appearing in a UTF-8 character
literal is not clear. 5.13.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.ccon#3">lex.ccon</A>] paragraph 3
assumes that the contents of the quoted string is a character with
an ISO 10646 code point value, which is not necessarily the case
with a numeric escape, and paragraph 8 could be read to indicate
that a numeric escape specifies the actual runtime value of the
object rather than a Unicode code point. In addition, paragraph
8 only specifies the result for unprefixed and wide-character
literals, not for UTF-8 literals, so that could be read as
indicating that a numeric escape in a UTF-8 character literal is
undefined behavior (i.e., not defined by the Standard).</P>

<P><B>Notes from the August, 2017 teleconference:</B></P>

<P>An escape sequence in a UTF-8 character literal should be ill-formed.</P>
