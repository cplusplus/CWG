<P>[Voted into the WP at the February, 2012 meeting;
moved to DR at the October, 2012 meeting.]</P>

<P>Split off from <A HREF="86.html">issue 86</A>.</P>

<P>Should binding a reference to the result of a "," operation
whose second operand is a temporary extend the lifetime of the
temporary?</P>
<PRE>
  const SFileName &amp;C = ( f(), SFileName("abc") );
</PRE>

<P><B>Notes from the March 2004 meeting:</B></P>

<P>We think the temporary should be extended.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (October, 2004):</B></P>

<P>Change 6.7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.temporary#2">class.temporary</A>] paragraph 2 as
indicated:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

... In all these cases, the temporaries created during the
evaluation of the expression initializing the reference, except
the temporary <INS>that is the overall result of the expression
[<I>Footnote:</I> For example, if the expression is a comma
expression (7.6.20 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.comma">expr.comma</A>]) and the value of its
second operand is a temporary, the reference is bound to that
temporary.] and</INS> to which the reference is bound, are destroyed at
the end of the full-expression in which they are created and in
the reverse order of the completion of their construction...

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><I>[Note: this wording partially resolves <A HREF="86.html">issue 86</A>.  See also <A HREF="446.html">issue 446</A>.]</I></P>

<P><B>Notes from the April, 2005 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The CWG suggested a different approach from the 10/2004 resolution,
leaving 6.7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.temporary">class.temporary</A>] unchanged and adding normative
wording to 7.6.20 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.comma">expr.comma</A>] specifying that, if the result
of the second operand is a temporary, that temporary is the result of
the comma expression as well.</P>

<P><B>Proposed Resolution (November, 2006):</B></P>

<P>Add the indicated wording to 7.6.20 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.comma#1">expr.comma</A>] paragraph 1:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

... The type and value of the result are the type and value of the
right operand; the result is of the same value category as its right
operand, and is a bit-field if its right operand is a glvalue and a
bit-field.  <INS>If the value of the right operand is a temporary
(6.7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.temporary">class.temporary</A>]), the result is that temporary.</INS>
