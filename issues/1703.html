<P>
<A HREF="4.html">Issue 4</A> separated the concepts of language
linkage for names and language linkage for types; since the names of
functions with internal linkage are not visible outside their (C++)
translation unit, there is no need to restrict overloading of
extern "C" functions with internal linkage, e.g.,</P>

<PRE>
  extern "C" {
    static void f();
    static void f(int);
  }
</PRE>

<P>although the types of such functions still have C language linkage
and thus can be called via a function pointer from C code.</P>

<P>The change permitting such overloading, however, has not been widely
implemented since the resolution of <A HREF="4.html">issue 4</A>,
leading some to suggest that the unnecessary restriction on function
overloading of such functions should be reimposed.</P>

<P>If it is decided to keep the resolution of <A HREF="4.html">issue 4</A>, 9.11 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.link#6">dcl.link</A>] paragraph 6 should be clarified:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

At most one function with a particular name can have C language linkage.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Presumably this was overlooked in implementing the intent of the
resolution for the issue and is a likely explanation for the reason
it is not more widely implemented.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (September, 2013):</B></P>

<P>There was no consensus in CWG for a change to the current rules.
9.11 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.link#6">dcl.link</A>] paragraph 6 should be read as applying to
the C language linkage of the name, not the function type.</P>
