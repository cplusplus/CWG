<P>[Voted into the WP at the September, 2008 meeting.]</P>



<P>The current wording of 9.2.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.constexpr#7">dcl.constexpr</A>] paragraph 7
seems not quite correct.  It reads,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A <TT>constexpr</TT> specifier used in an object declaration declares
the object as <TT>const</TT>. Such an object shall be initialized, and
every expression that appears in its initializer (9.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init">dcl.init</A>]) shall be a constant expression.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The phrase &#8220;every expression&#8221; is intended to cover
multiple arguments to a constexpr constructor and multiple expressions
in an aggregate initializer.  However, it could be read (incorrectly)
as saying that non-constant expressions cannot appear as subexpressions
in such initializers, even in places where they do not render the
full-expression non-constant (i.e., as unevaluated operands and in the
unselected branches of <TT>&amp;&amp;</TT>, <TT>||</TT>, and
<TT>?:</TT>).  Perhaps this problem could be remedied by replacing
&#8220;every expression&#8221; with &#8220;every
full-expression?&#8221;</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (June, 2008):</B></P>

<P>Change 9.2.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.constexpr#7">dcl.constexpr</A>] paragraph 7 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A <TT>constexpr</TT> specifier used in an object declaration declares
the object as <TT>const</TT>. Such an object shall be <DEL>initialized,
and every expression that appears in its initializer (8.5)</DEL>
<INS>initialized. If it is initialized by a constructor call, the
constructor shall be a constexpr constructor and every argument to the
constructor shall be a constant expression. Otherwise, every
full-expression that appears in its initializer</INS> shall be a
constant expression.  Every implicit conversion used...
