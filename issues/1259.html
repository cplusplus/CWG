Deleting a POD via a pointer to base
</H4>

<P>It is currently undefined behavior to delete a derived-class object
via a pointer to a base class unless the base class has a virtual
destructor.  It has been suggesed that this could be allowed for a
standard-layout class.  If so, presumably the caveats about a
deallocation function or non-trivial destructor found in 7.6.2.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.delete#5">expr.delete</A>] paragraph 5 that currently apply to incomplete types
would need to be extended to apply to the derived class in such cases.</P>

<P>Another objection that was raised is that such a change would make it
more difficult to extend C++ in the future to have global deallocation
functions that can take the size of the object being deleted as an
argument, as is currently possible for member deallocation functions.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (August, 2011):</B></P>

<P>The specification is as intended; changes to the restriction would
need to be considered in a larger context by EWG.</P>

<P><B>Additional note, April, 2015:</B></P>

<P>EWG has decided not to make a change in this area. See EWG issue
99.</P>
