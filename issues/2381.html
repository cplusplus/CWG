<P>[Accepted as a DR at the February, 2019 meeting.]</P>

<P>According to 7.3.14 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.fctptr#1">conv.fctptr</A>] paragraph 1,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A prvalue of type &#8220;pointer to member of type <TT>noexcept</TT>
function&#8221; can be converted to a prvalue of type
&#8220;pointer to member of type function&#8221;. The result
designates the member function.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>However, 7.2.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.type#4">expr.type</A>] paragraph 4 does not
allow for this conversion in determining the composite
pointer type of two pointers to member functions. The
corresponding conversion is considered for pointers to
non-member functions, but only qualification conversions are
considered for pointers to members:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The <I>composite pointer type</I> of two
operands <TT>p1</TT> and <TT>p2</TT> having
types <TT>T1</TT> and <TT>T2</TT>, respectively, where at
least one is a pointer or pointer-to-member type
or <TT>std::nullptr_t</TT>, is:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>...</P></LI>

<LI><P>if <TT>T1</TT> or <TT>T2</TT> is &#8220;pointer to
noexcept function&#8221; and the other type is
&#8220;pointer to function&#8221;, where the function types
are otherwise the same, &#8220;pointer to
function&#8221;;</P></LI>

<LI><P>...</P></LI>

<LI>

<P>if <TT>T1</TT> is &#8220;pointer to member of <TT>C1</TT>
of type <I>cv1</I> <TT>U1</TT>&#8221; and <TT>T2</TT>
is &#8220;pointer to member of <TT>C2</TT> of type <I>cv2</I>
<TT>U2</TT>&#8221; where <TT>C1</TT> is reference-related
to <TT>C2</TT> or <TT>C2</TT> is reference-related
to <TT>C1</TT> (9.4.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.ref">dcl.init.ref</A>]), the cv-combined
type of <TT>T2</TT> and <TT>T1</TT> or the cv-combined type
of <TT>T1</TT> and <TT>T2</TT>, respectively;</P>
</LI>

</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Note also that the places that refer to &#8220;composite
pointer type&#8221; only refer to 7.3.13 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.mem">conv.mem</A>]
for conversions involving pointers to members, omitting any
reference to 7.3.14 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.fctptr">conv.fctptr</A>] for pointers to
member functions. This affects 7.6.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.rel">expr.rel</A>],
7.6.10 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.eq">expr.eq</A>], and 7.6.16 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.cond">expr.cond</A>].</P>
