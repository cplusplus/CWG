<P>[Resolved by <A HREF="2382.html">issue 2382</A>, which was
accepted as a DR at the November, 2019 meeting.]</P>

<P>(See also <A HREF="256.html">issue 256</A>.)</P>

<P>An implementation may have an unspecified amount of array
allocation overhead (7.6.2.8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.new#10">expr.new</A>] paragraph 10),
so that evaluation of a <I>new-expression</I> in which the
<I>new-type-id</I> is <TT>T[n]</TT> involves a request for more
than <TT>n * sizeof(T)</TT> bytes of storage through the relevant
<TT>operator new[]</TT> function.</P>

<P>The placement <TT>operator new[]</TT> function does not and
cannot check whether the requested size is less than or equal to
the size of the provided region of memory (17.6.3.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/new.delete.placement">new.delete.placement</A>] paragraphs 5-6).  A program using placement
array new must calculate what the requested size will be in
advance.</P>

<P>Therefore any program using placement array new must take into
account the implementation's array allocation overhead, which
cannot be obtained or calculated by any portable means.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the April, 2005 meeting:</B></P>

<P>While the CWG agreed that there is no portable means to
accomplish this task in the current language, they felt that a
paper is needed to analyze the numerous mechanisms that might
address the problem and advance a specific proposal.  There is
no volunteer to write such a paper at this time.</P>

<P><B>Note, January, 2012:</B></P>

<P>It has been suggested that this issue is more appropriate for EWG
and should thus be closed with "extension" status.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (February, 2012):</B></P>

<P>The CWG agreed that EWG is the appropriate venue for dealing with
this issue.</P>

<P><B>Additional note (November, 2019):</B></P>

<P>The resolution of <A HREF="2382.html">issue 2382</A>
effectively addresses the request in this issue by eliminating
the array overhead in the case of the standard placement
allocator.</P>

<P><B>EWG (January, 2021):</B></P>

<P>Resolved by <A HREF="2382.html">issue 2382</A>.
See <A HREF="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p1018r8.html#CWG476">vote</A>.
