<P>According to 13.7.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.friend#5">temp.friend</A>] paragraph 5,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A member of a class template may be declared to be a friend
of a non-template class. In this case, the corresponding
member of every specialization of the class template is a
friend of the class granting friendship.  For explicit
specializations the corresponding member is the member (if
any) that has the same name, kind (type, function, class
template, or function template), template parameters, and
signature as the member of the class template instantiation
that would otherwise have been generated.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Should this treatment of members of explicit specializations
also apply to members of partial specializations?</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (February, 2014):</B></P>

<P>Change 13.7.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.friend#5">temp.friend</A>] paragraph 5 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A member of a class template may be declared to be a friend of a
non-template class. In this case, the corresponding member of every
specialization of the <INS>primary</INS> class template <INS>and class
template partial specializations thereof</INS> is a friend of the class
granting friendship.  For explicit specializations <INS>and specializations
of partial specializations,</INS> the corresponding member is the member
(if any) that has the same name, kind (type, function, class template, or
function template), template parameters, and signature as the member of the
class template instantiation that would otherwise have been
generated. [<I>Example:</I>...
