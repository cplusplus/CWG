<P>[Accepted as a DR at the March, 2024 meeting.]</P>

<P>Subclause 9.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct.def.default#5">dcl.fct.def.default</A>] paragraph 5 specifies:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

... A user-provided explicitly-defaulted function (i.e., explicitly
defaulted after its first declaration) is implicitly defined at the
point where it is explicitly defaulted; if such a function is
implicitly defined as deleted, the program is ill-formed. A
non-user-provided defaulted function (i.e., implicitly declared or
explicitly defaulted in the class) that is not defined as deleted is
implicitly defined when it is odr-used (6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr">basic.def.odr</A>]) or
needed for constant evaluation (7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.const">expr.const</A>]).

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In the first case, there is a second point of declaration for the
function, wherever the user wrote the definition.  In contrast, there
is no redeclaration for the second case, where the function is not
user-provided.  A note would clarify.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (approved by CWG 2024-03-20):</B></P>

<P>Insert a paragraph break before the quoted section and change in
9.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct.def.default#5">dcl.fct.def.default</A>] paragraph 5 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

... A function is <I>user-provided</I> if it is user-declared and not
explicitly defaulted or deleted on its first declaration.
A user-provided explicitly-defaulted function (i.e., explicitly
defaulted after its first declaration) is implicitly defined at the
point where it is explicitly defaulted; if such a function is
implicitly defined as deleted, the program is ill-formed.

<INS>[<I>Note 1:</I> Declaring a function as defaulted after its first
declaration can provide efficient execution and concise definition
while enabling a stable binary interface to an evolving code
base. &#8212;<I>end note</I>]</INS>

A non-user-provided defaulted function (i.e., implicitly declared or
explicitly defaulted in the class) that is not defined as deleted is
implicitly defined when it is odr-used (6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr">basic.def.odr</A>]) or
needed for constant evaluation (7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.const">expr.const</A>]).

<DEL>[<I>Note 1:</I> Declaring a function as defaulted after its first
declaration can provide efficient execution and concise definition
while enabling a stable binary interface to an evolving code
base. &#8212;<I>end note</I>]</DEL>

<INS>[ Note: The implicit definition of a non-user-provided defaulted
function does not bind any names.  -- end note ]</INS>
