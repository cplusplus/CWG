Nontype template arguments in constant expressions

<P>[Voted into the WP at the April, 2007 meeting as part of paper
J16/07-0095 = WG21 N2235.]</P>

<P>Consider:</P>

<PRE>
    template &lt;int* p&gt; struct S {
        static const int I = 3;
    };
    int i;
    int a[S&lt;&amp;i&gt;::I];
</PRE>

<P>Clearly this should be valid, but a pedantic reading of
7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.const">expr.const</A>] would suggest that this is invalid because
&#8220;<TT>&amp;i</TT>&#8221; is not permitted in integral constant
expressions.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (October, 2005):</B></P>

<P>Change the last sentence of 7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.const#1">expr.const</A>] paragraph 1
as indicated:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

In particular, except in <INS>non-type <I>template-argument</I>s
or</INS> <TT>sizeof</TT> expressions, functions, class objects,
pointers, or references shall not be used, and assignment, increment,
decrement, function-call, or comma operators shall not be used.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><I>(Note: the same text is changed by the resolution of
<A HREF="367.html">issue 367</A>.)</I></P>

<P><B>Notes from April, 2006 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The proposed resolution could potentially be read as saying that
the prohibited operations and operators would be permitted in integral
constant expressions that are non-type <I>template-argument</I>s.  John
Spicer is investigating an alternate approach, to say that expressions
in non-type template arguments are not part of the expression in which
the <I>template-id</I> appears (in contrast to the operand of
<TT>sizeof</TT>, which is part of the containing expression).</P>

<P><B>Additional note (May, 2008):</B></P>

<P>This issue is resolved by the rewrite of 7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.const">expr.const</A>]
that was done in conjunction with the constexpr proposal, paper
N2235.</P>
