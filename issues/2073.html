<P>According to 6.7.6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.dynamic.allocation#4">basic.stc.dynamic.allocation</A>] paragraph 4,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

[<I>Note:</I> In particular, a global allocation function is
not called to allocate storage for objects with static
storage duration (6.7.6.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.static">basic.stc.static</A>]), for objects
or references with thread storage duration
(6.7.6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.thread">basic.stc.thread</A>]), for objects of type
<TT>std::type_info</TT> (7.6.1.8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.typeid">expr.typeid</A>]), or for an
exception object (14.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/except.throw">except.throw</A>]). &#8212;<I>end
note</I>]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The restriction against allocating exception objects on the
heap was intended to ensure that heap exhaustion could be reported
by throwing an exception, i.e., that obtaining storage for
<TT>std::bad_alloc</TT> could not fail because the heap was full.
However, this implicitly relied on the assumption of a single
thread and does not scale to large numbers of threads, so the
restriction should be lifted and another mechanism found for
guaranteeing the ability to throw <TT>std::bad_alloc</TT>.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the February, 2016 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The prohibition of using an allocation function appears only in a
note, although there is a normative reference to the rule in
14.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/except.throw#4">except.throw</A>] paragraph 4. CWG was in favor of
retaining the prohibition of using a C++ allocation function for
the memory of an exception object, with the implicit understanding
that use of <TT>malloc</TT> would be permitted.  The resolution
for this issue should delete the note and move the prohibition to
normative text in the relevant sections.</P>
