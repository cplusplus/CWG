<P>
<TT>reinterpret_cast</TT> was forbidden in constant expressions to
prevent type-punning operations at compile time.  This may have been
too strict, as there are uses for the operator that do not involve
type punning.  For example, a portable implementation of the
<TT>addressof</TT> function could be written as a <TT>constexpr</TT>
function if <TT>reinterpret_cast</TT> could be used in a constant
expression.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (October, 2012):</B></P>

<P>Although <TT>reinterpret_cast</TT> was permitted in address constant
expressions in C++03, this restriction has been implemented in some
compilers and has not proved to break significant amounts of code.
CWG deemed that the complications of dealing with pointers whose tpes
changed (pointer arithmetic and dereference could not be permitted on
such pointers) outweighed the possible utility of relaxing the current
restriction.</P>
