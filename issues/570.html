<P>[Voted into WP at March, 2010 meeting as document N2993.]</P>



<P>6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr#1">basic.def.odr</A>] paragraph 1 says,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

No translation unit shall contain more than one definition of any
variable, function, class type, enumeration type or template.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This says nothing about references.  Is it permitted to define a
reference more than once in a single translation unit?  (The list in
paragraph 5 of things that can have definitions in multiple translation
units does not include references.)</P>

<P><B>Notes from the September, 2008 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The CWG expressed interest in an approach that would define
&#8220;variable&#8221; to include both objects and references and
to use that for both this issue and <A HREF="633.html">issue 633</A>.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (October, 2009):</B></P>

<P>This issue is resolved by the resolution of <A HREF="633.html">issue 633</A>.</P>
