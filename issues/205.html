Templates and static data members
</H4>

<P>Static data members of template classes and of nested classes of
template classes are not themselves templates but receive much the
same treatment as template.  For instance,
Clause 13 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp#1">temp</A>] paragraph 1
says that templates
are only "classes or functions" but implies that "a static data member
of a class template or of a class nested within a class template" is
defined using the <I>template-declaration</I> syntax.</P>

<P>There are many places in the clause, however, where static data
members of one sort or another are overlooked.  For instance,
Clause 13 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp#6">temp</A>] paragraph 6
allows static data
members of class templates to be declared with the <TT>export</TT>
keyword.  I would expect that static data members of (non-template)
classes nested within class templates could also be exported, but they
are not mentioned here.</P>

<P>Paragraph 8, however, overlooks static data members altogether and
deals only with "templates" in defining the effect of the
<TT>export</TT> keyword; there is no description of the semantics of
defining a static data member of a template to be exported.</P>

<P>These are just two instances of a systematic problem.  The entire
clause needs to be examined to determine which statements about
"templates" apply to static data members, and which statements about
"static data members of class templates" also apply to static data
members of non-template classes nested within class templates.</P>

<P>(The question also applies to member functions of template classes;
see <A HREF="217.html">issue 217</A>, where the phrase
"non-template function" in 9.3.4.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct.default#4">dcl.fct.default</A>] paragraph 4
is apparently intended <I>not</I> to include non-template member
functions of template classes.  See also <A HREF="108.html">issue 108</A>, which would benefit from understanding nested classes of
class templates as templates.  Also, see <A HREF="249.html">issue 249</A>, in which the usage of the phrase "member function
template" is questioned.)</P>

<P><B>Notes from the 4/02 meeting:</B></P>

<P>Daveed Vandevoorde will propose appropriate terminology.</P>
