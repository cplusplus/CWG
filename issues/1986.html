<P>The current wording of 6.9.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.start.static">basic.start.static</A>] allows deferral
of static and thread_local initialization until a variable or function
in the containing translation unit is odr-used.  This requires
implementations to avoid optimizing away the relevant odr-uses.  We
should consider relaxing the rule to allow for such optimizations.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (November, 2014):</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

For a variable <TT>V</TT> with thread or static storage duration,
let <TT>X</TT> be the set of all variables with the same storage duration
as <TT>V</TT> that are defined in the same translation unit
as <TT>V</TT>. If the observable behavior of the abstract machine
(6.7.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.object">intro.object</A>]) depends on the value of <TT>V</TT> through an
evaluation <I>E</I>, and <I>E</I> is not sequenced before the end of the
initialization of any variable in <TT>X</TT>, then the end of the
initialization of all variables in <TT>X</TT> is sequenced before <I>E</I>.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>There is also a problem (submitted by David Majnemer) if the odr-use
occurs in a constexpr context that does not require the variable to be
constructed.  For example,</P>

<PRE>
  struct A { A(); };
  thread_local A a;

  constexpr bool f() { return &amp;a != nullptr; }
</PRE>

<P>It doesn't seem possible to construct <TT>a</TT> before its
odr-use in <TT>f</TT>.</P>

<P>There is implementation divergence in the handling of this example.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the November, 2014 meeting:</B></P>

<P>CWG determined that the second part of the issue (involving
<TT>constexpr</TT>) is not a defect because the address of an
object with thread storage duration is not a constant
expression.</P>

<P><B>Additional note, May, 2015:</B></P>

<P>CWG failed to indicate where and how to apply the wording
in the proposed resolution.  In addition, further review has
raised concern that &#8220;sequenced before&#8221; may be the
wrong relation to use for the static storage duration case
because it implies &#8220;in the same thread.&#8221;</P>

<P><B>Notes from the October, 2015 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The suggested wording is intended to replace some existing
wording in 6.9.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.start.static#2">basic.start.static</A>] paragraph 2.  CWG
affirmed that the correct relationship is &#8220;happens
before&#8221; and not &#8220;sequenced before.&#8221;</P>
