<P>[Adopted at the November, 2018 meeting as part of paper P1236R1.]</P>



<P>The resolution of <A HREF="1796.html">issue 1796</A> addressed
only the relationship of &#8220;bits&#8221; with the null character
value.  The values and arrangements of bits within an object are also
mentioned in other contexts; these should also be considered for
revision.  For example, 7.6.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.shift#2">expr.shift</A>] paragraph 2 says,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The value of <TT>E1 &lt;&lt; E2</TT> is <TT>E1</TT>
left-shifted <TT>E2</TT> bit positions; vacated bits are zero-filled.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This appears to place constraints on the bit representation, which
(as noted in <A HREF="1796.html">issue 1796</A>) is not accessible
to the program.  A similar statement appears in paragraph 3 for
<TT>&gt;&gt;</TT>.</P>

<P>The specification of the bitwise operations in 7.6.11 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.bit.and">expr.bit.and</A>],
7.6.12 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.xor">expr.xor</A>], and 7.6.13 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.or">expr.or</A>] uses the undefined
term &#8220;bitwise&#8221; in describing the operations, without specifying
whether it is the value or object representation that is in view.</P>

<P>Part of the resolution of this might be to define &#8220;bit&#8221;
(which is otherwise currently undefined in C++) as a value of a given
power of 2.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the June, 2014 meeting:</B></P>

<P>CWG decided to reformulate the description of the operations
themselves to avoid references to bits, splitting off the larger
questions of defining &#8220;bit&#8221; and the like to
<A HREF="1943.html">issue 1943</A> for further
consideration.</P>
