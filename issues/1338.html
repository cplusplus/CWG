<P>[Moved to DR at the November, 2014 meeting.]</P>



<P>In 6.7.6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.dynamic.allocation#2">basic.stc.dynamic.allocation</A>] paragraph 2, allocation functions
are constrained to return a pointer that is different from any previously
returned pointer that has not been passed to a deallocation function.
This does not, for instance, prohibit returning a pointer to storage that
is part of another object, for example, a pool of storage.  The potential
implications of this for aliasing should be spelled out.</P>

<P>(See also issues <A HREF="1027.html">1027</A> and
<A HREF="1116.html">1116</A>.)</P>

<P><B>Additional note (March, 2013):</B></P>

<P>One possibility to allow reasonable optimizations would be to require
that allocation packages hide their storage in file-static variables,
perhaps by adding wording such as:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Furthermore, <TT>p0</TT> shall point to an object distinct from any other
object that is accessible outside the implementation of the allocation and
deallocation functions.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><B>Additional note, April, 2013:</B></P>

<P>Concern was expressed that a pool class might provide an
interface for iterating over all the pointers that were given out
from the pool, and this usage should be supported.
</P>

<P><B>Notes from the September, 2013 meeting:</B></P>

<P>CWG agreed that changes for this issue should apply only to
non-placement forms.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (February, 2014):</B></P>

<P>Change 6.7.6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.dynamic.allocation#2">basic.stc.dynamic.allocation</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

...If the request succeeds, the value returned shall be a non-null pointer
value (7.3.12 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.ptr">conv.ptr</A>]) <TT>p0</TT> different from any previously
returned value <TT>p1</TT>, unless that value <TT>p1</TT> was subsequently
passed to an <TT>operator delete</TT>. <INS>Furthermore, for the library
allocation functions in 17.6.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/new.delete.single">new.delete.single</A>] and
17.6.3.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/new.delete.array">new.delete.array</A>], <TT>p0</TT> shall point to a block of
storage disjoint from the storage for any other object accessible to the
caller.</INS> The effect of indirecting through a pointer returned as a
request for zero size is undefined.<SUP>36</SUP>
