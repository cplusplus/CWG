<P>[Moved to DR at the April, 2013 meeting.]</P>



<P>Even though <TT>A::C</TT> is a nested type and member of the current
instantiation, and thus dependent by the rules of
13.8.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.dep.type#8">temp.dep.type</A>] paragraph 8, there does not seem to be a
good reason for making it so:</P>

<PRE>
  struct B {
   struct C { };
  };

  template&lt;typename T&gt; struct A : B {
   A::C c;
  };
</PRE>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (October, 2012):</B></P>

<P><I>[Some existing uses of the term &#8220;member of the current
instantiation&#8221; are consistent with the definition in
13.8.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.dep.type#4">temp.dep.type</A>] paragraph 4; others are intended to
refer to members of the &#8220;current instantiation,&#8221; as
defined in paragraph 1.  The following resolution changes the
latter to use the phrase &#8220;member of a class that is the
current instantiation.&#8221;]</I></P>
