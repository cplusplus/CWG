<P>[Voted into the WP at the March, 2011 meeting as part of paper N3262.]</P>

<P>It seems odd to have an implicitly declared copy constructor (and
the same for the copy assignment operator) if one of the subobjects
does not have one.  For example,</P>

<PRE>
    struct A {
       A();
       A(A&amp;&amp;);
    };

    struct B: A { };

    B b;
    B b2(b); //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> error when implicitly defining </SPAN>B(B&amp;)<SPAN CLASS="cmnt">, should not be declared</SPAN>
</PRE>

<P>If we don't declare it in that case, we need to decide what happens
if one base has only a move constructor and another has only a copy
constructor.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the November, 2010 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The consensus of the CWG was to change the behavior so that all
classes have a declaration of a copy constructor, but that it is
defined as deleted in the cases where the declaration is omitted
by the current rules.</P>
