<P>[Accepted at the November, 2020 meeting as part of paper P2029R4.]</P>

<P>According to 5.13.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.ccon#4">lex.ccon</A>] paragraph 4,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The escape <TT>\ooo</TT> consists of the backslash followed by one, two, or
three octal digits that are taken to specify the value of the desired
character. The escape <TT>\xhhh</TT> consists of the backslash followed
by <TT>x</TT> followed by one or more hexadecimal digits that are taken to
specify the value of the desired character. There is no limit to the number
of digits in a hexadecimal sequence. A sequence of octal or hexadecimal
digits is terminated by the first character that is not an octal digit or a
hexadecimal digit, respectively. The value of a character literal is
implementation-defined if it falls outside of the implementation-defined
range defined for <TT>char</TT> (for literals with no
prefix), <TT>char16_t</TT> (for literals prefixed
by <TT>'u'</TT>), <TT>char32_t</TT> (for literals prefixed
by <TT>'U'</TT>), or <TT>wchar_t</TT> (for literals prefixed
by <TT>'L'</TT>).

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It is not clearly stated whether the &#8220;desired character&#8221;
being specified reflects the source or the target encoding.  This
particularly affects UTF-8 string literals (5.13.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.string#7">lex.string</A>] paragraph 7)
:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A string literal that begins with <TT>u8</TT>, such as <TT>u8"asdf"</TT>,
is a UTF-8 string literal and is initialized with the given characters as
encoded in UTF-8.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>For example, assuming the source encoding is Latin-1, is
<TT>u8"\xff"</TT> supposed to specify a three-byte string whose
first two bytes are <TT>0xc3 0xbf</TT> (the UTF-8 encoding of
<TT>\u00ff</TT>) or a two-byte string whose first byte has the
value <TT>0xff</TT>?  (At least some current implementations assume the
latter interpretation.)</P>

<P><B>Notes from the September, 2013 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The second interpretation (that the escape sequence specifies the
execution-time code unit) is intended.</P>
