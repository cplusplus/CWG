Are unique addresses required for namespace-scope variables?

<P>[Voted into WP at March, 2010 meeting.]</P>

<P>Consider the following example:</P>

<PRE>
    static const char test1 = 'x';
    static const char test2 = 'x';
    bool f() {
        return &amp;test1 != &amp;test2;
    }
</PRE>

<P>Is <TT>f()</TT> allowed to return <TT>false</TT>?  Can a smart
optimizer alias these two variables, taking advantage of the fact that
they are <TT>const</TT>, initialized to the same value, and thus can
never be different in a well-defined program?</P>

<P>The C++ Standard doesn't explicitly specify address allocation of
objects except as members of arrays and classes, so the answer would
appear to be that such an implementation would be conforming.</P>

<P>This situation appears to have been the inadvertent result of
the resolution of <A HREF="73.html">issue 73</A>. Prior to that
change, 7.6.10 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.eq">expr.eq</A>] said,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Two pointers of the same type compare equal if and only if they...
both point to the same object...

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>That resolution introduced the current wording,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Two pointers of the same type compare equal if and only if... both
represent the same address.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Notes from the March, 2009 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The CWG agreed that this aliasing should not be permitted in
a conforming implementation.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (November, 2009):</B></P>

<OL>
<LI><P>Add the following as a new paragraph after 6.7.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.object#5">intro.object</A>] paragraph 5:</P></LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><INS>Unless an object is a bit-field or a base class subobject
of zero size, the address of that object is the address of the
first byte it occupies. Two distinct objects that are neither
bit-fields nor base class subobjects of zero size shall have
distinct addresses [<I>Footnote:</I> Under the &#8220;as-if&#8221;
rule an implementation is allowed to store two objects at the
same machine address or not store an object at all if the program
cannot observe the difference (6.9.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.execution">intro.execution</A>]). &#8212;<I>end footnote</I>].
[<I>Example:</I></INS></P>

<PRE>
<INS>  static const char test1 = 'x';
  static const char test2 = 'x';
  const bool b = &amp;test1 != &amp;test2;   //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> always true</SPAN></INS>
</PRE>

<P><INS>&#8212;<I>end example</I>]</INS></P>

<LI><P>Change 7.6.2.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.unary.op#3">expr.unary.op</A>] paragraph 3 as follows:</P></LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The result of the unary <TT>&amp;</TT> operator is a pointer to
its operand. The operand shall be an lvalue or a
<I>qualified-id</I>. <DEL>In the first case, if the type of the
expression is &#8220;<TT>T</TT>,&#8221; the type of the result is
&#8220;pointer to <TT>T</TT>.&#8221; In particular, the address
of an object of type &#8220;<I>cv</I> <TT>T</TT>&#8221; is
&#8220;pointer to <I>cv</I> <TT>T</TT>,&#8221; with the same
cv-qualifiers. For a <I>qualified-id</I>, if the member is a
static member of type &#8220;<TT>T</TT>&#8221;, the type of the
result is plain &#8220;pointer to <TT>T</TT>.&#8221; If the
member is a non-static member of class <TT>C</TT> of type
<TT>T</TT>, the type of the result is &#8220;pointer to member of
class <TT>C</TT> of type <TT>T</TT>.&#8221;</DEL> <INS>If the
operand is a <I>qualified-id</I> naming a non-static member
<TT>m</TT> of some class <TT>C</TT> with type <TT>T</TT>, the
result has type &#8220;pointer to member of class <TT>C</TT> of
type <TT>T</TT>&#8221; and is an rvalue designating
<TT>C::m</TT>.  Otherwise, if the type of the expression is
<TT>T</TT>, the result has type &#8220;pointer to
<TT>T</TT>&#8221; and is an rvalue that is the address of the
designated object (6.7.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.memory">intro.memory</A>]) or a pointer to the
designated function. [<I>Note:</I> In particular, the address of
an object of type &#8220;<I>cv</I> <TT>T</TT>&#8221; is
&#8220;pointer to <I>cv</I> <TT>T</TT>,&#8221; with the same
cv-qualification. &#8212;<I>end note</I>]</INS> [<I>Example:</I>...
