<P>Code that was portable in C90 and C++98 is no longer portable with
the introduction of data types longer than <TT>long</TT>; code that
could previously cast <TT>size_t</TT> and <TT>ptrdiff_t</TT> to
<TT>long</TT> without loss of precision (because <TT>long</TT> was
the largest type) can no longer rely on that idiom.</P>

<P>The CWG discussed this during the Berlin (April, 2006) meeting.  The
general consensus was that this was unavoidable: there are valid
reasons for implementations to keep <TT>long</TT> at a size less than
that required for address arithmetic.</P>

<P>See paper J16/06-0053 = WG21 N1983, which also suggests the
possibility of required diagnostics for problematic cases as an
alternative to restricting the size of <TT>size_t</TT> and
<TT>ptrdiff_t</TT>.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (October, 2006):</B></P>

<P>This is not an area in which the Standard should override the
decisions of implementors who wish to maintain the size of
<TT>long</TT> for backward compatibility but need a
larger <TT>size_t</TT> to deal with expanded address spaces.  Also,
diagnostics of the sort described are better treated as quality of
implementation issues rather than topics for standardization.</P>
