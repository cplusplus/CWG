<OL>
<LI><P>&#8220;Combining characters should not appear as the first
character of an identifier.&#8221;
[Reference: ISO/IEC TR 10176:2003 (Annex A)]
This is not reflected in FCD.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Restrictions on the first character of an identifier are not
observed as recommended in TR 10176:2003. The inclusion of digits
(outside of those in the basic character set) under
<I>identifer-nondigit</I> is implied by FCD.</P></LI>

<LI><P>It is implied that only the &#8220;main listing&#8221; from
Annex A is included for C++.  That is, the list ends with the Special
Characters section.  This is not made explicit in FCD. Existing
practice in C++03 as well as WG 14 (C, as of N1425) and WG 4 (COBOL,
as of N4315) is to include a list in a normative Annex.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Specify width sensitivity as implied by C++03: <TT>\uFF21</TT>
is not the same as A.  Case sensitivity is already stated in
5.11 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.name">lex.name</A>].</P></LI>

</OL>

<P><B>Notes from the August, 2010 meeting:</B></P>

<P>CWG expressed interest in an approach by which all characters
except for those in specifically-excluded categories would be
acceptable identifier characters.  This suggestion will be
brought up with WG14 as a liaison matter in hopes of agreeing
on a uniform approach between C and C++.</P>
