<P>[Accepted as a DR at the March, 2018 (Jacksonville) meeting.]</P>

<P>The current wording does not state that a specialization of a static
data member template (Clause 13 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp#1">temp</A>] paragraph 1) is a static
data member, which leaves the status of an example like the following
unclear (since 7.6.1.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.ref#4.1">expr.ref</A>] bullet 4.1 is phrased in
terms of static data members):</P>

<PRE>
  template &lt;class T&gt; struct A {
    template &lt;class U&gt; static const U x = 1;
    static const int y = 2;
  };

  int main() {
    A&lt;int&gt; a;
    int y = a.y;         //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> OK</SPAN>
    int x = a.x&lt;int&gt;;    //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> ???</SPAN>
  }
</PRE>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (November, 2017)</B></P>

<P>Change 13.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.spec#2">temp.spec</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A function instantiated from a function template is called an instantiated
function. A class instantiated from a class template is called an
instantiated class. A member function, a member class, a member
enumeration, or a static data member of a class template instantiated from
the member definition of the class template is called, respectively, an
instantiated member function, member class, member enumeration, or static
data member. A member function instantiated from a member function template
is called an instantiated member function. A member class instantiated from
a member class template is called an instantiated member class. <INS>A
variable instantiated from a variable template is called an instantiated
variable. A static data member instantiated from a static data member
template is called an instantiated static data member.</INS>
