<P>It is not clear from 7.6.2.8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.new">expr.new</A>] whether a deleted
<TT>operator delete</TT> is referenced by a <I>new-expression</I> in
which there is no initialization or in which the initialization cannot
throw an exception, rendering the program ill-formed.  (The question
also arises as to whether such a
<I>new-expression</I> constitutes a &#8220;use&#8221; of the
deallocation function in the sense of 6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr">basic.def.odr</A>].)</P>

<P><B>Notes from the July, 2009 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The rationale for defining a deallocation function as deleted would
presumably be to prevent such objects from being freed.  Treating the
<I>new-expression</I> as a use of such a deallocation function would
mean that such objects could not be created in the first place.  There
is already an exemption from freeing an object if &#8220;a suitable
deallocation function [cannot] be found;&#8221; a deleted deallocation
function should be treated similarly.</P>

<P><B>Additional notes (April, 2023):</B></P>



<P>An additional use-case for a deleted deallocation function would be
to ensure that the initialization of the object is not
potentially-throwing.</P>

<P>For cases where the deallocation function is never called from
the constructor, access checking for it should not be done.</P>
