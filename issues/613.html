<P>[Voted into WP at April, 2007 meeting.]</P>



<P>According to 11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem#9">class.mem</A>] paragraph 9, the name of a
non-static data member can only be used with an object reference
(explicit or implied by the <TT>this</TT> pointer of a non-static
member function) or to form a pointer to member.  This restriction
applies even in the operand of <TT>sizeof</TT>, although the
operand is not evaluated and thus no object is needed to perform the
operation.  Consequently, determining the size of a non-static class
member often requires a circumlocution like
</P>

<PRE>
    sizeof ((C*) 0)-&gt;m
</PRE>

<P>instead of the simpler and more obvious (but incorrect)</P>

<PRE>
    sizeof (C::m)
</PRE>

<P>The CWG considered this question as part of
<A HREF="198.html">issue 198</A> and decided at that time to
retain the restriction on consistency grounds: the rule was
viewed as applying uniformly to expressions, and making an
exception for <TT>sizeof</TT> would require introducing a
special-purpose &#8220;wart.&#8221;</P>

<P>The issue has recently resurfaced, in part due to the fact that
the restriction would also apply to the <TT>decltype</TT> operator.
Like the unary <TT>&amp;</TT> operator to form a pointer to member,
<TT>sizeof</TT> and <TT>decltype</TT> need neither an lvalue nor
an rvalue, requiring solely the declarative information of the
named operand.  One possible approach would be to define the concept
of &#8220;unevaluated operand&#8221; or the like, exempt unevaluated
operands from the requirement for an object reference in
11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem#9">class.mem</A>] paragraph 9, and then define the operands
of these operators as &#8220;unevaluated.&#8221;</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (April, 2007):</B></P>

<P>The wording is given in paper J16/07-0113 = WG21 N2253.</P>
