Definitions of unused static members

<P>Also see section: 6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr">basic.def.odr</A>]
.</P>

<P>Originally, all static data members still had to be defined outside the
class whether they were used or not.</P>

<P>But that restriction was supposed to be lifted so that static
data members need not be defined outside the class unless they are used
in a manner which requires their definition,
in the same manner as namespace-scope
variables. In particular, if an integral/enum const static data member
is initialized within the class, and its address is never taken, we agreed
that no namespace-scope definition was required.</P>

<P>For example:</P>
<PRE>
    struct A {
        static const int size = 10;
        int array[size];
    };

    int main() {
        A a;
        return 0;
    }
</PRE>
However, 11.4.9.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.static.data#4">class.static.data</A>] paragraph 4
says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>The member shall still be defined in a namespace scope if it
is used in the program and the namespace scope definition shall not contain
an initializer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
A narrow interpreration of "used" in this rule would make the example ill-formed
because there is no namespace-scope definition of "<TT>size</TT>".
A better wording for this rule would be:
<BLOCKQUOTE>The member shall still be defined in a namespace scope if it
is used in the program in the manner described in 6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr">basic.def.odr</A>]
.
The namespace scope definition shall not contain an initializer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Also, the wording in 6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr#2">basic.def.odr</A>] paragraph 2:

<BLOCKQUOTE>An expression is potentially evaluated unless either it is
the operand of the <TT>sizeof</TT> operator (7.6.2.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.sizeof">expr.sizeof</A>]
), or it is the operand
of the <TT>typeid</TT> operator and does not designate an lvalue of polymorphic
class type (7.6.1.8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.typeid">expr.typeid</A>]
).</BLOCKQUOTE>
is incomplete because it does not mention the use of a compile-time constant
as an array bound or template argument. It should say something like:
<BLOCKQUOTE>An expression is potentially evaluated unless it is the operand
of the sizeof operator (7.6.2.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.sizeof">expr.sizeof</A>]
), the operand of the typeid operator,
<U>an <I>integral constant-expression</I> used as an array bound or an
<I>integral constant-expression</I> used as a <I>template-argument</I>
for a non-reference <I>template-parameter</I></U>; and the expression
does not designate an lvalue of polymorphic class type (7.6.1.8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.typeid">expr.typeid</A>]
).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>Proposed Resolution (04/99):</B>
Change the first sentence of 6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr">basic.def.odr</A>]

paragraph 2 from:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An expression is <I>potentially evaluated</I> unless either
it is the operand of the <TT>sizeof</TT> operator (7.6.2.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.sizeof">expr.sizeof</A>]
), or it is the
operand of the <TT>typeid</TT> operator and does not designate an lvalue
of polymorphic class type (7.6.1.8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.typeid">expr.typeid</A>]
).</BLOCKQUOTE>
to:
<BLOCKQUOTE>An expression is <I>potentially evaluated</I> unless <U>it
appears where an <I>integral constant expression</I> is required (see 7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.const">expr.const</A>]
),
is
</U>the operand of the <TT>sizeof</TT> operator (7.6.2.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.sizeof">expr.sizeof</A>]
), or
is the operand of the <TT>typeid</TT> operator and the expression does
not designate an lvalue of polymorphic class type (7.6.1.8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.typeid">expr.typeid</A>]
).</BLOCKQUOTE>
