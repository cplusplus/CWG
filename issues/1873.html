<P>According to 11.8.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.access.base#5">class.access.base</A>] paragraph 5,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>A member <TT>m</TT> is accessible at the point <I>R</I> when named in
class <TT>N</TT> if</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>...</P></LI>

<LI><P>
<TT>m</TT> as a member of <TT>N</TT> is protected, and <I>R</I> occurs in a member or friend of
class <TT>N</TT>, or in a member or friend of a class <TT>P</TT> derived from <TT>N</TT>, where <TT>m</TT> as a
member of <TT>P</TT> is public, private, or protected, or</P></LI>

<P>The granting of access via class <TT>P</TT> is troubling.  At the
least, there should be a restriction that <TT>P</TT> be visible at
<I>R</I>.  Alternatively, this portion of the rule could be removed
altogether; this provision does not appear to be widely used in
existing code and such references can be easily converted to use
<TT>P</TT> instead of <TT>N</TT> for naming the member.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the June, 2014 meeting:</B></P>

<P>CWG noted that removing the <TT>friend</TT> provision would
introduce an undesirable asymmetry between member functions
of <TT>P</TT> and its friends. Instead, the intent is to require
<TT>P</TT> to be a complete type at <I>R</I>.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the November, 2014 meeting:</B></P>

<P>Although the asymmetry is unfortunate, the difference
between a reference in a member function and a reference in
a friend is that the member function concretely determines
which <TT>P</TT> is in view, while the friend could be
befriended by a class that is a specialization of a class
template and thus would require instantiations that would
not otherwise occur.  CWG thus decided simply to eliminate
the friend case.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution, November, 2014:</B></P>

<P>Change bullet 5.3 of 11.8.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.access.base">class.access.base</A>] as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>...A member <TT>m</TT> is accessible at the
point <I>R</I> when named in class <TT>N</TT> if</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>...</P></LI>

<LI><P>
<TT>m</TT> as a member of <TT>N</TT> is protected,
and <I>R</I> occurs in a member or friend of
class <TT>N</TT>, or in a member <DEL>or friend</DEL> of a
class <TT>P</TT> derived from <TT>N</TT>, where <TT>m</TT>
as a member of <TT>P</TT> is public, private, or protected,
or</P></LI>

<LI><P>there exists...</P></LI>
