<P>[Voted into the WP at the March, 2011 meeting as part of paper N3262.]</P>

<P>The current wording of the Standard does not recognize the fact
that the alignment of a complete object of a given type may be
different from its alignment as a subobject.  This arises in
particular with virtual base classes.  For example,</P>

<PRE>
    struct B { long double d; };
    struct D: virtual B { char c; };
</PRE>

<P>When <TT>D</TT> is a complete object, it will have a subobject of
type <TT>B</TT>, which must be aligned appropriately for a <TT>long
double</TT>.  On the other hand, if <TT>D</TT> appears as a subobject
of another object, the <TT>B</TT> subobject might be part of a
different subobject, reducing the alignment requirement on the
<TT>D</TT> subobject.</P>

<P>The Standard should make clear that it is the complete-object
alignment that is being described, in parallel with the distinction
between the size of a complete object and a subobject of the same
type.</P>
