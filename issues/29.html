Linkage of locally declared functions

<P>[Moved to DR at October 2002 meeting.  This was incorrectly
marked as having DR status between 4/01 and 4/02.  It was overlooked
when <A HREF="4.html">issue 4</A> was moved to DR at the 4/01
meeting; this one should have been moved as well, because it's resolved
by the changes there.]</P>



<P>Consider the following:</P>
<PRE>
    extern "C" void foo()
    {
        extern void bar();
        bar();
    }
</PRE>
Does "bar()" have "C" language linkage?

<P>The ARM is explicit and says</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A linkage-specification for a function also applies to functions
and objects declared within it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
The DIS says
<BLOCKQUOTE>In a <I>linkage-specification</I>, the specified language linkage
applies to the function types of all function declarators, function names,
and variable names introduced by the declaration(s).</BLOCKQUOTE>
Is the body of a function definition part of the declaration?

<P><U>From Mike Miller:</U></P>

<P>Yes: from 9.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.pre#1">dcl.pre</A>] paragraph 1,
</P>
<UL>
<I>declaration:</I>
<UL><I>function-definition</I></UL>
</UL>
and 9.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct.def#1">dcl.fct.def</A>] paragraph 1:

<UL>
<I>function-definition:</I>
<UL><I>decl-specifier-seq<SUB>opt</SUB> declarator ctor-initializer<SUB>opt</SUB>&#160;function-body</I></UL>
</UL>
At least that's how I'd read it.

<P><U>From Dag Br&#252;ck:</U></P>

<P>Consider the
following where extern "C" has been moved to a separate declaration:</P>
<PRE>
    extern "C" void foo();

    void foo() { extern void bar(); bar(); }
</PRE>
I think the ARM wording could possibly be interpreted such that bar() has
"C" linkage in my example, but not the DIS wording.

<P>As a side note, I have always wanted to think that placing extern "C"
on a function definition or a separate declaration would produce identical
programs.</P>

<P><B>Proposed Resolution (04/01):</B></P>

<P>See the proposed resolution for
<A HREF="4.html">Core issue 4</A>, which covers this case.</P>

<P>The ODR should also be checked to see whether it addresses name and
type linkage.</P>
