<P>According to 13.7.6.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.spec.partial.general#1">temp.spec.partial.general</A>] paragraph 1,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A partial specialization shall be declared before the first
use of a class template specialization that would make use
of the partial specialization as the result of an implicit
or explicit instantiation in every translation unit in which
such a use occurs; no diagnostic is required.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>There are two problems with this wording.  First, the
&#8220;no diagnostic required&#8221; provision is presumably
to avoid mandating cross-translation-unit analysis, but there
is no reason not to require the diagnostic if the rule is
violated within a single translation unit.  Also, &#8220;would
make use&#8221; is imprecise; it could be interpreted as
applying only when the partial specialization would have been
selected by a previous specialization, but it should also apply to
cases where the partial specialization would have made a
previous specialization ambiguous.</P>

<P>Making these two changes would guarantee that a diagnostic is
issued for the following example:</P>

<PRE>
   template &lt;class T1, class T2&gt; class A;
   template &lt;class T&gt; struct A&lt;T, void&gt; { void f(); };
   template &lt;class T&gt; void g(T) { A&lt;char, void&gt;().f(); }   //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> #1</SPAN>
   template&lt;typename T&gt; struct A&lt;char, T&gt; {};
   A&lt;char, void&gt; f;   //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> #2</SPAN>
</PRE>

<P>It is unspecified whether the reference to
<TT>A&lt;char, void&gt;</TT> at #1 is the &#8220;first
use&#8221; or not.  If so, <TT>A&lt;char, void&gt;</TT>
is bound to the first partial specialization and, under the
current wording, an implementation is not required to
diagnose the ambiguity resulting from the second partial
specialization.  If #2 is the &#8220;first use,&#8221; it is
clearly ambiguous and must result in a diagnostic.  There is
implementation divergence on the handling of this example
that would be addressed by the suggested changes.</P>
