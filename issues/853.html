<P>[Voted into WP at March, 2010 meeting.]</P>



<P>According to _N4885_.20.10.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/util.dynamic.safety#16">util.dynamic.safety</A>] paragraph 16,
when <TT>std::get_pointer_safety()</TT> returns
<TT>std::pointer_safety::relaxed</TT>,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

pointers that are not safely derived will be treated the same as
pointers that are safely derived for the duration of the program.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>However, _N4885_6.7.5.5.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.dynamic.safety#4">basic.stc.dynamic.safety</A>] paragraph 4 says
unconditionally that</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If a pointer value that is not a safely-derived pointer value is
dereferenced or deallocated, and the referenced complete object is of
dynamic storage duration and has not previously been declared
reachable (_N4885_.20.10.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/util.dynamic.safety">util.dynamic.safety</A>]), the behavior is undefined.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This is a contradiction: the library clause attempts to constrain
undefined behavior, which by definition is unconstrained.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (July, 2009):</B></P>

<P>Change _N4885_6.7.5.5.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.dynamic.safety#4">basic.stc.dynamic.safety</A>] paragraph 4 as follows to
define the terms &#8220;strict pointer safety&#8221; and
&#8220;relaxed pointer safety,&#8221; which could then be used by
the library clauses to achieve the desired effect:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<INS>An implementation may have <I>relaxed pointer safety</I>, in which
case the validity of a pointer value does not depend on whether it is
a safely-derived pointer value or not.  Alternatively, an
implementation may have <I>strict pointer safety</I>, in which case
if</INS> <DEL>If</DEL> a pointer value that is not a safely-derived pointer
value is dereferenced or deallocated, and the referenced complete
object is of dynamic storage duration and has not previously been
declared reachable (_N4885_.20.10.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/util.dynamic.safety">util.dynamic.safety</A>]), the behavior is
undefined.  [<I>Note:</I> this is true even if the unsafely-derived
pointer value might compare equal to some safely-derived pointer
value. &#8212;<I>end note</I>] <INS>It is implementation-defined whether
an implementation has relaxed or strict pointer safety.</INS>
