<P>[Accepted at the October, 2021 meeting as part of paper P2314R4.]</P>

<P>According to 5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.phases#1">lex.phases</A>] paragraph 1, in translation
phase 1,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Any source file character not in the basic source character set
(5.3.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.charset">lex.charset</A>]) is replaced by the
universal-character-name that designates that character.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If a character that is not in the basic character set is preceded
by a backslash character, for example</P>

<PRE>
    "\&#225;"
</PRE>

<P>the result is equivalent to</P>

<PRE>
    "\\u00e1"
</PRE>

<P>that is, a backslash character followed by the spelling of the
universal-character-name.  This is different from the result in C99,
which accepts characters from the extended source character set without
replacing them with universal-character-names.</P>

<P>See also <A HREF="1335.html">issue 1335</A>.</P>

<P><B>Additional note (February, 2022):</B></P>

<P>P2314R4 Character sets and encodings (approved in October, 2021)
effected changes so that extended characters are no longer translated
to UCNs in phase 1.</P>
