<P>[Voted into WP at March, 2010 meeting.]</P>

<P>It is presumably possible to declare a defaulted copy constructor
to be <TT>explicit</TT>.  Should that render a class not trivially
copyable, even though the copy constructor is trivial?  That is,
does being &#8220;trivally copyable&#8221; mean that copy
initialization, and not just direct initialization, is possible?</P>

<P>A related question is whether the specification of triviality
should require that the copy constructor and copy assignment operator
must be public.  (With the advent of &#8220;<TT>=default</TT>&#8221; it
is possible to make them non-public, which was not the case when these
definitions were crafted.)</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (October, 2009):</B></P>

<P>This issues is resolved by the resolution of
<A HREF="906.html">issue 906</A>.</P>
