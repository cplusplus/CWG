<B>Jack Rouse:</B>
6.7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.life#1">basic.life</A>] paragraph 1

includes:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The lifetime of an object is a runtime property of the object. The
lifetime of an object of type <TT>T</TT> begins when:
<UL>
<LI>storage with the proper alignment and size for type <TT>T</TT>
is obtained, and</LI>

<LI>if <TT>T</TT> is a class type with a non-trivial constructor
(11.4.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.ctor">class.ctor</A>]
), the
constructor call has completed.</LI>
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Consider the code:
<PRE>
    struct B {
        B( int = 0 );
        ~B();
    };

    struct S {
        B b1;
    };

    int main()
    {
        S s = { 1 };
        return 0;
    }
</PRE>

In the code above, class <TT>S</TT> does have a non-trivial constructor, the
default constructor generated by the compiler.  According the text
above, the lifetime of the auto <TT>s</TT> would never begin because a
constructor for <TT>S</TT> is never called.  I think the second case in the
text needs to include aggregate initialization.

<P>
<B>Mike Miller:</B>
I see a couple of ways of fixing the problem.  One way would be
to change "the constructor call has completed" to "the object's
initialization is complete."</P>

<P>Another would be to add following "a class type with a non-trivial
constructor" the phrase "that is not initialized with the brace
notation (9.4.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.aggr">dcl.init.aggr</A>]
)."</P>

<P>The first formulation treats aggregate initialization like a
constructor call; even POD-type members of an aggregate could
not be accessed before the aggregate initialization completed.
The second is less restrictive; the POD-type members of the
aggregate would be usable before the initialization, and the
members with non-trivial constructors (the only way an
aggregate can acquire a non-trivial constructor) would be
protected by recursive application of the lifetime rule.</P>

<P>
<B>Proposed resolution (04/01):</B> </P>

<P>In 6.7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.life#1">basic.life</A>] paragraph 1, change</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If <TT>T</TT> is a class type with a non-trivial constructor
(11.4.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.ctor">class.ctor</A>]), the constructor call has
completed.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If <TT>T</TT> is a class type with a non-trivial constructor
(11.4.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.ctor">class.ctor</A>]), the initialization is complete.
[<I>Note:</I> the initialization can be performed by a
constructor call or, in the case of an aggregate with an
implicitly-declared non-trivial default constructor, an
aggregate initialization (9.4.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.aggr">dcl.init.aggr</A>]).]
