<P>[Accepted as a DR at the July, 2019 meeting.]</P>



<P>According to 6.7.6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.dynamic.allocation#2">basic.stc.dynamic.allocation</A>] paragraph 2,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

For an allocation function other than a reserved placement allocation
function (17.6.3.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/new.delete.placement">new.delete.placement</A>]), the pointer returned is suitably
aligned so that it can be converted to a pointer to any suitable complete
object type (17.6.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/new.delete.single">new.delete.single</A>]) and then used to access the
object or array in the storage allocated (until the storage is explicitly
deallocated by a call to a corresponding deallocation function).

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This requirement seems excessive, as it appears to require
the strictest fundamental alignment even for objects that are
too small to require such an alignment.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (March, 2019):</B></P>

<OL>
<LI><P>Change 6.7.6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.dynamic.allocation#2">basic.stc.dynamic.allocation</A>] paragraph 2 as
follows:</P></LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

...The order, contiguity, and initial value of storage
allocated by successive calls to an allocation function are
unspecified. <DEL>For an allocation function other than a
reserved placement allocation function
(17.6.3.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/new.delete.placement">new.delete.placement</A>]), the pointer returned is
suitably aligned so that it can be converted to a pointer to
any suitable complete object type
(17.6.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/new.delete.single">new.delete.single</A>]) and then used to access the
object or array in the storage allocated (until the storage
is explicitly deallocated by a call to a corresponding
deallocation function).</DEL> Even if the size of the space
requested...

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI><P>Add the following as a new paragraph to
6.7.6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.dynamic.allocation">basic.stc.dynamic.allocation</A>] after the existing paragraph 2:</P></LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><INS>For an allocation function other than a
reserved placement allocation function
(17.6.3.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/new.delete.placement">new.delete.placement</A>]), the pointer returned on a
successful call shall represent the address of storage that
is aligned as follows:</INS></P>

<UL>
<LI><P><INS>If the allocation function takes an argument
of type <TT>std::align_val_t</TT>, then the storage will
have the alignment specified by the value of this
argument.</INS></P></LI>

<LI><P><INS>Otherwise, if the allocation function is
named <TT>operator new[]</TT>, then the storage is aligned
for any object that does not have new-extended alignment
(6.7.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.align">basic.align</A>]) and is no larger than the
requested size.</INS></P></LI>

<LI><P><INS>Otherwise, the storage is aligned for any object that does not have new-extended alignment and is of the requested size.</INS></P></LI>

</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI><P>Change 17.6.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/new.delete.single#1">new.delete.single</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P></LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Effects:</I> The allocation functions
(6.7.6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.dynamic.allocation">basic.stc.dynamic.allocation</A>]) called by
a <I>new-expression</I> (7.6.2.8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.new">expr.new</A>]) to
allocate <TT>size</TT> bytes of storage. The second form is
called for a type with new-extended alignment,
and <DEL>allocates storage with the specified
alignment. The</DEL> <INS>the</INS> first form is called
otherwise<DEL>, and allocates storage suitably aligned to
represent any object of that size provided the object's type
does not have new-extended alignment</DEL>.
