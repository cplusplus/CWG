<P>The following line in the example in
11.8.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.protected#1">class.protected</A>] paragraph 1 is no longer allowed
following the change from <A HREF="1873.html">issue 1873</A>:</P>

<PRE>
  class B {
  protected:
    int i;
    static int j;
  };
  // ...
  class D2 : public B {
    friend void fr(B*, D1*, D2*);
    void mem(B*, D1*);
  };
  void fr(B* pb, D1* p1, D2* p2) {
    // ...
    p2-&gt;B::i = 4;  // <SPAN CLASS="cmnt">OK (access through a </SPAN>D2<SPAN CLASS="cmnt">, even though naming class is </SPAN>B<SPAN CLASS="cmnt">)</SPAN>
    // ...
  }
</PRE>

<P>The example line ought to work, but none of the bullets in
11.8.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.access.base#5">class.access.base</A>] paragraph 5 apply:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A member m is accessible at the point R when named in class N if
<UL>
<LI>m as a member of N is public, or</LI>
<LI>m as a member of N is private, and R occurs in a direct member or friend of class N, or</LI>
<LI>m as a member of N is protected, and R occurs in a direct
member or friend of class N, or in a member of a class P derived from
N, where m as a member of P is public, private, or protected, or</LI>
<LI>there exists a base class B of N that is accessible at R, and m
is accessible at R when named in class B.</LI>
</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>One aproach might be that 11.8.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.access.base#5.3">class.access.base</A>] bullet 5.3
should also consider friends of a class P derived from N where P is
the type of the object expression (if any) or a base class thereof,
and m as a member of P is public, protected, or private.</P>
