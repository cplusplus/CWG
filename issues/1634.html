<P>According to 6.7.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc#2">basic.stc</A>] paragraph 2,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Static, thread, and automatic storage durations are associated with objects
introduced by declarations (6.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def">basic.def</A>]) and implicitly
created by the implementation (6.7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.temporary">class.temporary</A>]).

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The apparent intent of the reference to 6.7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.temporary">class.temporary</A>] is
that a temporary whose lifetime is extended to be that of a reference with
one of those storage durations is considered also to have that storage
duration.  This interpretation is buttressed by use of the phrase &#8220;an
object with the same storage duration as the temporary&#8221; (twice) in
6.7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.temporary#5">class.temporary</A>] paragraph 5.</P>

<P>There are two problems, however: first, the specification of lifetime
extension of temporaries (also in 6.7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.temporary#5">class.temporary</A>] paragraph 5)
does not say anything about storage duration.  Also, nothing is said in
either of these locations about the storage duration of a temporary whose
lifetime is not extended.</P>

<P>The latter point is important because 6.7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.life">basic.life</A>] makes
a distinction between the lifetime of an object and the acquisition and
release of the storage the object occupies, at least for objects with
non-trivial initialization and/or a non-trivial destructor.  The
assumption is made in 6.7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.temporary">class.temporary</A>] and elsewhere that the
storage in which a temporary is created is no longer available for
reuse, as specified in 6.7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.life">basic.life</A>], after the lifetime of
the temporary has ended, but this assumption is not explicitly stated.
One way to make that assumption explicit would be to define a storage
duration for temporaries whose lifetime is not extended.</P>
