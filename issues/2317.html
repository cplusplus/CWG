<P>[Accepted as a DR at the February, 2019 meeting.]</P>



<P>Consider an example like:</P>

<PRE>
  struct A {
    int n = A{}.n;
  };
</PRE>

<P>There doesn't seem to be a good reason to support this kind of thing,
and it would be simpler to say that a default member initializer can't
trigger any direct or indirect use of itself in general, rather than just
the two special cases that were banned by issues <A HREF="1696.html">1696</A> and <A HREF="1397.html">1397</A>.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the March, 2018 meeting:</B></P>

<P>There was a suggestion that creating an object of the containing
class in a default member initializer should be prohibited. That would
presumably be a difference between the reference member and non-reference
member cases, since the intent is to allow creation of a temporary for
a reference member to bind to. The suggested approach for drafting was
simply to remove the restriction to references in 9.4.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.aggr#11">dcl.init.aggr</A>] paragraph 11.
</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (November, 2018):</B></P>

<P>Change 9.4.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.aggr#12">dcl.init.aggr</A>] paragraph 12 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If a <DEL>reference</DEL> member <DEL>is initialized from
its</DEL> <INS>has a</INS> default member initializer and a
potentially-evaluated subexpression thereof is an aggregate
initialization that would use that default member
initializer, the program is ill-formed.  [<I>Example:</I>

<PRE>
  struct A;
  extern A a;
  struct A {
    const A&amp; a1 { A{a,a} }; //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> OK</SPAN>
    const A&amp; a2 { A{} };    //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> error</SPAN>
  };
  A a{a,a};                 //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> OK</SPAN>

<INS>  struct B {
  int n = B{}.n;            //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> error</SPAN>
  };</INS>
</PRE>
