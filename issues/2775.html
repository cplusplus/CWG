<P>[Accepted as a DR at the March, 2024 meeting.]</P>

<P>Subclause 14.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/except.throw#5">except.throw</A>] paragraph 5 specifies:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

When the thrown object is a class object, the constructor selected for
the copy-initialization as well as the constructor selected for a
copy-initialization considering the thrown object as an lvalue shall
be non-deleted and accessible, even if the copy/move operation is
elided (11.9.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.elision">class.copy.elision</A>]). The destructor is potentially
invoked (11.4.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.dtor">class.dtor</A>]).

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This provision is for capturing a copy constructor for
implementations not using reference-counted
<TT>std::exception_ptr</TT>s, but that ought to be described
separately from the "thrown object", which can be interpreted as the
operand of the <I>throw-expression</I>.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (approved by CWG 2023-09-15) [SUPERSEDED]:</B></P>

<P>Change in 14.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/except.throw#5">except.throw</A>] paragraph 5 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<DEL>When the thrown object is a class object, the constructor selected for
the copy-initialization as well as the constructor selected for a
copy-initialization considering the thrown object as an lvalue shall
be non-deleted and accessible, even if the copy/move operation is
elided (11.9.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.elision">class.copy.elision</A>]).</DEL>

<INS>Let <TT>T</TT> denote the type of the exception
object. Copy-initialization of an object of type <TT>T</TT> from an
lvalue of type <TT>const T</TT> in a context unrelated to any class
shall be well-formed.  If <TT>T</TT> is a class type,</INS>
<DEL>The</DEL> <INS>the</INS> destructor <INS>of <TT>T</TT></INS> is
potentially invoked (11.4.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.dtor">class.dtor</A>]).

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>CWG 2023-11-09</B></P>

<P>The drafting should also consider odr-use of the constructor
potentially invoked for the copy-initialization.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (approved by CWG 2023-11-10) [SUPERSEDED]:</B></P>

<P>Change in 6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr#9">basic.def.odr</A>] paragraph 9 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

An assignment operator function in a class is odr-used by an
implicitly-defined copy assignment or move assignment function for
another class as specified in 11.4.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.assign">class.copy.assign</A>]. A
constructor for a class is odr-used as specified in
9.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init">dcl.init</A>] <INS>and when selected for the potential
copy-initialization as specified in 14.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/except.throw">except.throw</A>]</INS>. A
destructor for a class is odr-used if it is potentially invoked
(11.4.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.dtor">class.dtor</A>]).
