<P>As described in the &#8220;additional note, January, 2012&#8221; in
<A HREF="1287.html">issue 1287</A>, questions were raised regarding the
treatment of class prvalues in the original proposed resolution and the
proposed resolution was revised (February, 2012) to address those concerns.
The revised resolution raised its own set of concerns with regard to
slicing and performance, however, and the issue was moved back to "review"
status to allow further discussion. 
</P>

<P>At the April, 2013 meeting, it was decided to proceed with the original
resolution of <A HREF="1287.html">issue 1287</A> and split off the
concerns regarding class prvalues into this issue.</P>



<P><B>Notes from the September, 2013 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The resolution for <A HREF="1604.html">issue 1604</A> results in
indirect binding to a subobject and will no longer cause slicing.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (November, 2013):</B></P>

<P>CWG determined that, in light of the resolution of
<A HREF="1604.html">issue 1604</A>, no further change was necessary.</P>
