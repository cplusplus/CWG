<P>[Voted into WP at October 2005 meeting.]</P>


<P>13.9.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.explicit#7">temp.explicit</A>] paragraph 7 says,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The explicit instantiation of a class template specialization
implies the instantiation of all of its members not previously
explicitly specialized in the translation unit containing the
explicit instantiation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It's not clear whether this &#8220;implied&#8221;
instantiation is implicit or explicit instantiation.  It makes a
difference in cases like the following:</P>

<PRE>
    template &lt;typename T&gt; struct foo {
        struct bar { };
    };

    template struct foo&lt;int&gt;;         // #1

    template struct foo&lt;int&gt;::bar;    // #2
</PRE>

<P>If the instantiation of <TT>foo&lt;int&gt;::bar</TT> implied
by <TT>#1</TT> is implicit, the explicit instantiation in
<TT>#2</TT> is well-formed.  Otherwise, <TT>#2</TT> violates the
requirement in 13.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.spec">temp.spec</A>] that</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
No program shall explicitly instantiate any template more than
once ... for a given set of <I>template-argument</I>s.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It's also unclear whether the implied instantiation applies
only to direct members of the class template or to inherited
members, as well.</P>

<P>
<U>John Spicer:</U> I have always interpreted this as meaning
only the members declared in the class, not those inherited from
other classes.  This is what EDG does, and appears to be what
g++, Microsoft and Sun do, too.  I also think this is the correct
thing for the Standard to require.  If I were to derive a class
from a class in the standard library, an explicit instantiation
of my class should not cause the explicit instantiation of things
in the standard library (because the library might provide such
explicit instantiations, thus causing my program to run afoul of
the "can't instantiate more than once" rule).</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (October, 2004):</B></P>

<P>Change 13.9.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.explicit#7">temp.explicit</A>] paragraph 7 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The explicit instantiation of a class template specialization
<DEL>implies the instantiation of all</DEL> <INS>also explicitly
instantiates each</INS> of its members <DEL>not</DEL> <INS>(not including
members inherited from base classes) whose definition is visible at
the point of instantiation and that has not been</INS> previously
explicitly specialized in the translation unit containing the explicit
instantiation.
