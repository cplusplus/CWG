<P>Consider this code:</P>
<PRE>
    struct Base {
        enum { a, b, c, next };
    };

    struct Derived : public Base {
        enum { d = Base::next, e, f, next };
    };

</PRE>
The idea is that the enumerator "next" in each class is the next available
value for enumerators in further derived classes.

<P>If we had written</P>
<PRE>
    enum { d = next, e, f, next };

</PRE>
I think we would run afoul of 6.4.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.scope.class">basic.scope.class</A>]
:
<BLOCKQUOTE>A name <TT>N</TT> used in a class <TT>S</TT> shall refer to
the same declaration in its context and when re-evaluated in the completed
scope of <TT>S</TT>. No diagnostic is required for a violation of this
rule.</BLOCKQUOTE>
But in the original code, we don't have an unqualified "next" that refers
to anything but the current scope. I think the intent was to allow the
code, but I don't find the wording clear on on that point.

<P>Is there another section that makes it clear whether the original code
is valid? Or am I being obtuse? Or should the quoted section say "An unqualified
name N used in a class ..."?</P>

<P>
<B>Rationale (04/99):</B> It is sufficiently clear that "name"
includes qualified names and hence the usual lookup rules make this
legal.</P>
