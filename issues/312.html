<P>[Moved to DR at the April, 2013 meeting.]</P>

<P>6.7.6.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation#4">basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation</A>] paragraph 4 mentions that the effect
of using an invalid pointer value is undefined. However, the standard
never says what it means to 'use' a value.</P>

<P>There are a number of possible interpretations, but it appears that
each of them leads to undesired conclusions:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
A value is 'used' in a program if a variable holding this value
appears in an expression that is evaluated.
This interpretation would render the sequence
<PRE>
   int *x = new int(0);
   delete x;
   x = 0;
</PRE>
into undefined behaviour. As this is a common idiom, this is
clearly undesirable.
</LI>
<LI>
A value is 'used' if an expression evaluates to that value.
This would render the sequence
<PRE>
   int *x = new int(0);
   delete x;
   x-&gt;~int();
</PRE>
into undefined behaviour; according to _N4778_.7.6.1.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.pseudo">expr.pseudo</A>],
the variable x is
'evaluated' as part of evaluating the pseudo destructor call. This,
in turn, would mean that all containers (Clause 23 [<A href="https://wg21.link/containers">containers</A>])
of pointers show
undefined behaviour, e.g. 23.3.9.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/list.modifiers">list.modifiers</A>]
requires to invoke the
destructor as part of the <TT>clear()</TT> method of the container.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>If any other meaning was intended for 'using an expression', that
meaning should be stated explicitly.</P>

<P>(See also <A HREF="623.html">issue 623</A>.)</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (February, 2012):</B></P>

<P>This issue is resolved by the resolution of
<A HREF="616.html">issue 616</A>.</P>
