<P>(From submission

</P>

<P>Subclause 7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.arith.conv#1">expr.arith.conv</A>] paragraph 1 specifies:</P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>

Many binary operators that expect operands of arithmetic or
enumeration type cause conversions and yield result types in a similar
way. The purpose is to yield a common type, which is also the type of
the result. ...

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>However, while the relational and equality operators do apply the
usual arithmetic conversions, their result type is <TT>bool</TT> and
not the common type from the usual arithmetic conversions.</P>

<P><U>Suggested resolution:</U></P>

<OL>
<LI>
<P>Change in 7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.arith.conv#1">expr.arith.conv</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Many binary operators that expect operands of arithmetic or
enumeration type cause conversions <DEL>and yield result types</DEL>
in a similar way. The purpose is to yield a common type<DEL>, which is
also the type of the result</DEL>. ...

<LI>
<P>Change in 7.6.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.mul#2">expr.mul</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

The operands of * and / shall have arithmetic or unscoped enumeration
type; the operands of % shall have integral or unscoped enumeration
type. The usual arithmetic conversions (7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.arith.conv">expr.arith.conv</A>]) are
performed on the operands <INS>to bring them to a common type,</INS>
and <DEL>determine the type of</DEL> the result <INS>is a prvalue of
that type</INS>.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>Change in 7.6.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.add#1">expr.add</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The additive operators + and - group left-to-right. Each operand shall
be a prvalue. <INS>The result is a prvalue.</INS> If both operands
have arithmetic or unscoped enumeration type, the usual arithmetic
conversions (7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.arith.conv">expr.arith.conv</A>]) are performed <INS>on the
operands to bring them to a common type, and the result is of that
type</INS>. Otherwise, if one operand has arithmetic or unscoped
enumeration type, integral promotion is applied
(7.3.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.prom">conv.prom</A>]) to that operand. A converted or promoted
operand is used in place of the corresponding original operand for the
remainder of this section.

<LI>
<P>Change in 7.6.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.rel#2">expr.rel</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The converted operands shall have arithmetic, enumeration, or pointer
type. The operators &lt; (less than), &gt; (greater than), &lt;= (less
than or equal to), and &gt;= (greater than or equal to) all yield
<INS>prvalues of</INS> <DEL>false or true. The</DEL> type <DEL>of the
result is</DEL> bool.

<LI>
<P>Change in 7.6.10 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.eq#2">expr.eq</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The converted operands shall have scalar type. The operators == and !=
both yield <DEL>true or false, i.e.,</DEL>
a <DEL>result</DEL> <INS>prvalue</INS> of type bool. In each case
below, the operands shall have the same type after the specified
conversions have been applied.

<LI>
<P>Change in 7.6.11 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.bit.and#1">expr.bit.and</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

The &amp; operator groups left-to-right. The operands shall be of
integral or unscoped enumeration type. The usual arithmetic
conversions (7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.arith.conv">expr.arith.conv</A>]) are performed <INS>on the
operands to bring them to a common type, and the result is a prvalue of
that type</INS>. Given the coefficients xi and yi of the base-2
representation (6.8.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.fundamental">basic.fundamental</A>]) of the converted operands
x and y, the coefficient ri of the base-2 representation of the result
r is 1 if both xi and yi are 1, and 0 otherwise.

<LI>
<P>Change in 7.6.12 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.xor#1">expr.xor</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The ^ operator groups left-to-right. The operands shall be of integral
or unscoped enumeration type. The usual arithmetic conversions
(7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.arith.conv">expr.arith.conv</A>]) are performed <INS>on the operands to bring
them to a common type, and the result is a prvalue of that
type</INS>. Given the coefficients xi and yi of the base-2
representation (6.8.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.fundamental">basic.fundamental</A>]) of the converted operands
x and y, the coefficient ri of the base-2 representation of the result
r is 1 if either (but not both) of xi and yi is 1, and 0 otherwise.

<LI>
<P>Change in 7.6.13 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.or#1">expr.or</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The | operator groups left-to-right. The operands shall be of integral
or unscoped enumeration type. The usual arithmetic conversions
(7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.arith.conv">expr.arith.conv</A>]) are performed <INS>on the operands to bring
them to a common type, and the result is a prvalue of that
type</INS>. Given the coefficients xi and yi of the base-2
representation (6.8.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.fundamental">basic.fundamental</A>]) of the converted operands
x and y, the coefficient ri of the base-2 representation of the result
r is 1 if at least one of xi and yi is 1, and 0 otherwise.
