Can template functions and classes be declared in the same scope?

<P>[Accepted at the November, 2020 meeting as part of paper P1787R6 and
moved to DR at the February, 2021 meeting.]</P>



<P>According to Clause 13 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp#5">temp</A>] paragraph 5,
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Except that a function template can be overloaded either by
(non-template) functions with the same name or by other function
templates with the same name
(13.10.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.over">temp.over</A>]
), a template name declared
in namespace scope or in class scope shall be unique in that scope.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
_N4868_.6.4.10 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.scope.hiding#2">basic.scope.hiding</A>] paragraph 2
agrees
that only functions, not function templates, can hide a class name
declared in the same scope:
<BLOCKQUOTE>

A class name (11.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.name">class.name</A>]
) or
enumeration name (9.7.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.enum">dcl.enum</A>]
) can be
hidden by the name of an object, function, or enumerator declared in
the same scope.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
However, 6.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.scope#4">basic.scope</A>] paragraph 4

treats functions and template functions together in this regard:
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Given a set of declarations in a single declarative region, each of
which specifies the same unqualified name,

<UL>
<LI>they shall all refer to the same entity, or all refer to functions
and function templates; or</LI>

<LI>exactly one declaration shall declare a class name or enumeration
name that is not a typedef name and the other declarations shall all
refer to the same object or enumerator, or all refer to functions and
function templates; in this case the class name or enumeration name is
hidden</LI>

</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>John Spicer:</B> You should be able to take an existing program
and replace an existing function with a function template without
breaking unrelated parts of the program.

In addition, all of the compilers I tried allow this usage (EDG, Sun,
egcs, Watcom, Microsoft, Borland).

I would recommend that function templates be handled exactly like functions
for purposes of name hiding.</P>

<P>
<B>Martin O'Riordan:</B> I don't see any justification for extending
the purview of what is decidedly a hack, just for the sake of consistency.
In fact, I think we should go further and in the interest of consistency, we
should deprecate the hack, scheduling its eventual removal from the C++
language standard.</P>

<P>The hack is there to allow old C programs and especially the
'stat.h' file to compile with minimum effort (also several other Posix and X
headers).  People changing such older programs have ample opportunity to "do
it right".  Indeed, if you are adding templates to an existing program, you
should probably be placing your templates in a 'namespace', so the issue
disappears anyway.  The lookup rules should be able to provide the behaviour
you need without further hacking.</P>
