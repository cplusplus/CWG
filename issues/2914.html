<P>(From submission
<A HREF="https://github.com/cplusplus/CWG/issues/559">#559</A>.)</P>

<P>Specification is missing that clarifies that non-local variables
with static storage duration are initialized before those with thread
storage duration.</P>

<P><U>Suggested resolution:</U></P>

<OL>
<LI>
<P>Change in 6.9.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.start.static#1">basic.start.static</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Variables with static storage duration are initialized as a
consequence of program initiation. Variables with thread storage
duration are initialized as a consequence of thread execution.
<INS>
If the program does not start a thread (6.9.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.multithread">intro.multithread</A>])
other than the main thread (6.9.3.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.start.main">basic.start.main</A>]) before the
completion of all non-deferred (6.9.3.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.start.dynamic">basic.start.dynamic</A>])
initialization of non-block variables with static storage duration,
then all non-deferred initialization (if any) of non-block variables
with static storage duration strongly happens before any non-deferred
initialization of non-block variables with thread storage duration.
</INS>
Within each of these phases of initiation, initialization occurs as follows.

<P>Change in 6.9.3.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.start.dynamic#5">basic.start.dynamic</A>] paragraph 5 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

It is implementation-defined whether the dynamic initialization of a
non-block non-inline variable <INS><I>o</I></INS> with static storage
duration is sequenced before the first statement of main or is
deferred. If it is deferred, it strongly happens before any
non-initialization odr-use of any non-inline function or non-inline
variable defined in the same translation unit as <DEL>the variable to
be initialized</DEL> <INS><I>o</I> and any deferred initialiation of
non-inline non-block variables with thread storage duration defined in
the same translation unit as <I>o</I></INS>. [ Footnote: ... ] It is
implementation-defined in which threads and at which points in the
program such deferred dynamic initialization occurs.
