<P>[Moved to DR at October 2002 meeting.]</P>

<P>This concerns the inconsistent treatment of cv qualifiers on
reference types and function types. The problem originated with
GCC bug report c++/2810. The bug report is available at
<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl?cmd=view&amp;pr=2810&amp;database=gcc">
http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl?cmd=view&amp;pr=2810&amp;database=gcc
</A>
</P>

<P>9.3.4.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.ref">dcl.ref</A>] describes references. Of interest is
the statement (my emphasis)</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Cv-qualified references are ill-formed <B>except</B> when
the cv-qualifiers are introduced through the use of a typedef
or of a template type argument, in which case the cv-qualifiers
are ignored.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Though it is strange to ignore 'volatile' here, that is not the point
of this defect report. 9.3.4.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct">dcl.fct</A>] describes function types.
Paragraph 4 states,</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In fact, if at any time in the determination of a type a
cv-qualified function type is formed, the program is ill-formed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>No allowance for typedefs or template type parameters is
made here, which is inconsistent with the equivalent reference case.</P>

<P>The GCC bug report was template code which attempted to do,</P>
<PRE>
    template &lt;typename T&gt; void foo (T const &amp;);
    void baz ();
    ...
    foo (baz);
</PRE>

<P>in the instantiation of foo, <TT>T</TT> is `<TT>void ()</TT>' and an attempt
is made to const qualify that, which is ill-formed. This is a surprise.</P>

<P><B>Suggested resolution:</B></P>

<P>Replace the quoted sentence from paragraph 4 in
9.3.4.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct">dcl.fct</A>] with</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
cv-qualified functions are ill-formed, except when the
cv-qualifiers are introduced through the use of a typedef or of
a template type argument, in which case the cv-qualifiers are
ignored.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Adjust the example following to reflect this.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (10/01):</B></P>

<P>In 9.3.4.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct#4">dcl.fct</A>] paragraph 4, replace
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The effect of a <I>cv-qualifier-seq</I> in a function declarator is
not the same as adding cv-qualification on top of the function type,
i.e., it does not create a cv-qualified function type.  In fact, if at
any time in the determination of a type a cv-qualified function type
is formed, the program is ill-formed. [<I>Example:
</I>
<PRE>
  typedef void F();
  struct S {
    const F f;          // ill-formed
  };
</PRE>
<I>-- end example</I>]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
by
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The effect of a <I>cv-qualifier-seq</I> in a function declarator is
not the same as adding cv-qualification on top of the function type.
In the latter case, the cv-qualifiers are ignored.  [<I>Example:
</I>
<PRE>
  typedef void F();
  struct S {
    const F f;          // ok; equivalent to void f();
  };
</PRE>
<I>-- end example</I>]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>Strike the last bulleted item in 13.10.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.deduct#2">temp.deduct</A>] paragraph 2,
 which reads
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Attempting to create a cv-qualified function type.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>
<U>Nathan Sidwell</U> comments (18 Dec 2001
):
The proposed resolution simply states attempts to add cv qualification
on top of a function type are ignored.  There is no mention of whether
the function type was introduced via a typedef or template type parameter.
This would appear to allow
<PRE>
  void (const *fptr) ();
</PRE>
but, that is not permitted by the grammar.  This is inconsistent
with the wording of adding cv qualifiers to a reference type, which does
mention typedefs and template parameters, even though
<PRE>
  int &amp;const ref;
</PRE>
is also not allowed by the grammar.</P>

<P>Is this difference intentional? It seems needlessly confusing.</P>

<P><B>Notes from 4/02 meeting:</B></P>

<P>Yes, the difference is intentional.  There is no way to add cv-qualifiers
other than those cases.</P>

<P><B>Notes from April 2003 meeting:</B></P>

<P>Nathan Sidwell pointed out that some libraries use the inability to
add const to a type T as a way of testing that T is a function
type.  He will get back to us if he has a proposal for a change.</P>
