Polymorphic behavior during destruction

<P>Consider the following example:</P>

<PRE>
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  struct Base {
    Base *p;
    virtual void f() { puts("base"); }
    ~Base() {
      p-&gt;f();
    }
  };
  struct Derived : Base {
    Derived() { p = this; }
    void f() { puts("derived"); }
    void g() {
      p-&gt;f();
      delete this;
    }
  };
  void h() {
    Derived *p = new Derived;
    p-&gt;g();
  }
</PRE>

<P>Should this have defined behavior? On the one hand, the
<TT>Derived</TT> object is in its period of destruction, so
the behavior of the <TT>p-&gt;f()</TT> call in
the <TT>Base</TT> destructor should be to
call <TT>Base::f()</TT>. On the other hand, <TT>p</TT> is a
pointer to a <TT>Derived</TT> object whose lifetime has
ended, and the rules in 6.7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.life">basic.life</A>] don't
appear to allow the call. (Calling <TT>this-&gt;f()</TT>
from the <TT>Base</TT> destructor would be OK &#8212; the
question is whether you can do that for a pointer that used
to point to the derived object, or if you can only do it for
a pointer that was &#8220;created&#8221; after the dynamic
type of the object changed to be <TT>Base</TT>.)</P>

<P>If the above is valid, it has severe implications for
devirtualization. The purpose of 6.7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.life#7">basic.life</A>] paragraph 7
appears to be to allow an implementation to
assume that if it will perform two loads of a constant field
(for instance, a const member, the implicit pointer for a
reference member, or a vptr), and the two loads are
performed on the &#8220;same pointer value&#8221;, then
they load the same value.</P>

<P>Should there be a rule for destructors similar to that
of 11.4.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.ctor#12">class.ctor</A>] paragraph 12?</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

During the construction of a const object, if the value of
the object or any of its subobjects is accessed through a
glvalue that is not obtained, directly or indirectly, from
the constructor's this pointer, the value of the object or
subobject thus obtained is unspecified.
