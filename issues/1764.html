<P>[Moved to DR at the February, 2014 meeting.]</P>

<P>According to 9.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/namespace.udecl#15">namespace.udecl</A>] paragraph 15,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

When a <I>using-declaration</I> brings names from a base class into a
derived class scope, member functions and member function templates in the
derived class override and/or hide member functions and member function
templates with the same name, parameter-type-list
(9.3.4.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct">dcl.fct</A>]), cv-qualification, and <I>ref-qualifier</I>
(if any) in a base class (rather than conflicting).

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The algorithm for class-scope name lookup given in
6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.member.lookup">class.member.lookup</A>], however, does not implement this requirement;
there is nothing that removes a hidden base class member (replacing
the <I>using-declaration</I>, per paragraph 3) from the result set.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (September, 2013):</B></P>

<P>Change 6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.member.lookup#3">class.member.lookup</A>] paragraph 3 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The <I>lookup set</I> for <TT>f</TT> in <TT>C</TT>, called <I>S(f, C)</I>,
consists of two component sets: the <I>declaration set</I>, a set of
members named <TT>f</TT>; and the <I>subobject set</I>, a set of subobjects
where declarations of these members (possibly
including <I>using-declaration</I>s) were found. In the declaration
set, <I>using-declaration</I>s are replaced by the <DEL>members they
designate</DEL> <INS>set of designated members that are not hidden or
overridden by members of the derived class
(9.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/namespace.udecl">namespace.udecl</A>])</INS>, and type declarations (including
injected-class-names) are replaced by the types they designate...
