Overload resolution of <TT>&amp;x.static_func</TT>

<P>[Accepted as a DR at the November, 2023 meeting.]</P>

<P>The Standard is not clear whether the following example is
well-formed or not:</P>

<PRE>
    struct S {
        static void f(int);
        static void f(double);
    };
    S s;
    void (*pf)(int) = &amp;s.f;
</PRE>

<P>According to 7.6.1.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.ref#4.3">expr.ref</A>] bullet 4.3,
you do function overload resolution to determine whether
<TT>x.f</TT> is a static or non-static member function.
7.6.2.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.unary.op#6">expr.unary.op</A>] paragraph 6 says that you can only
take the address of an overloaded function in a context that
determines the overload to be chosen, and the initialization of a
function pointer is such a context (12.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.over#1">over.over</A>] paragraph 1)
.  The problem is that 12.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.over">over.over</A>] is
phrased in terms of &#8220;an overloaded function name,&#8221;
and this is a member access expression, not a name.</P>

<P>There is variability among implementations as to whether this
example is accepted; some accept it as written, some only if the
<TT>&amp;</TT> is omitted, and some reject it in both forms.</P>

<P><B>Additional note (October, 2010):</B></P>

<P>A related question concerns an example like</P>

<PRE>
    struct S {
        static void g(int*) {}
        static void g(long) {}
    } s;

    void foo() {
        (&amp;s.g)(0L);
    }
</PRE>

<P>Because the address occurs in a call context and not in one of
the contexts mentioned in 12.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.over#1">over.over</A>] paragraph 1,
the call expression in <TT>foo</TT> is presumably ill-formed.
Contrast this with the similar example</P>

<PRE>
    void g1(int*) {}
    void g1(long) {}

    void foo1() {
        (&amp;g1)(0L);
    }
</PRE>

<P>This call presumably is well-formed because 12.2.2.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.match.call">over.match.call</A>] applies to &#8220;the address of a set of overloaded
functions.&#8221; (This was clearer in the wording prior to the
resolution of <A HREF="704.html">issue 704</A>: &#8220;...in
this context using <TT>&amp;F</TT> behaves the same as using the
name <TT>F</TT> by itself.&#8221;) It's not clear that there's any
reason to treat these two cases differently.</P>

<P>This question also bears on the original question of this issue,
since the original wording of 12.2.2.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.match.call">over.match.call</A>] also
described the case of an ordinary member function call like
<TT>s.g(0L)</TT> as involving the &#8220;name&#8221; of the function,
even though the <I>postfix-expression</I> is a member access
expression and not a &#8220;name.&#8221; Perhaps the reference to
&#8220;name&#8221; in 12.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.over">over.over</A>] should be similarly
understood as applying to member access expressions?</P>



<P><B>Additional notes (February, 2023)</B></P>

<P>This appears to be resolved, in part by P1787R6 (accepted November, 2020).</P>

<P><B>CWG 2023-06-12</B></P>

<P>The clarifications in P1787R6 did not address the core of this
issue, so it is kept open.  In order to avoid confusion, a wording
change to clarify the treatment (regardless of direction) seems
advisable. CWG felt that the first and second examples should be
treated consistently, and expressed a mild preferences towards making
those ill-formed.  It was noted that the reference
to <I>id-expression</I> in 12.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.over">over.over</A>] can be understood
to refer to the <I>id-expression</I> of a class member access.</P>

<P>This issue is resolved by <A HREF="2725.html">issue 2725</A>.</P>
