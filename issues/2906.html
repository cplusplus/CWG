<P>[Accepted as a DR at the November, 2024 meeting.]</P>

<P>(From submission
<A HREF="https://github.com/cplusplus/CWG/issues/550">#550</A>.)</P>

<P>There are two known situations where the lvalue-to-rvalue
conversion is applied to class types, which can be non-constexpr even
if the resulting copy constructor invocation would be constexpr
(7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.const#5.9">expr.const</A>] bullet 5.9).  The other such situation is
7.6.1.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.call#11">expr.call</A>] paragraph 11.  Here, the concern is with
7.6.16 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.cond#7">expr.cond</A>] paragraph 7, which can be invoked for class
types; for example:</P>

<PRE>
  struct S {};
  S a;
  constexpr S b = a;        //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> OK, call to implicitly-declared copy constructor</SPAN>
  constexpr S d = false ? S{} : a; //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> error: lvalue-to-rvalue conversion of 'a' is not a constant expression</SPAN>
</PRE>

<P>Major implementations disagree with the ill-formed outcome.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (approved by CWG 2024-06-26):</B></P>

<P>Change in 7.6.16 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.cond#7">expr.cond</A>] paragraph 7 as follows:</P>

<LI>The second and third operands have arithmetic or enumeration type;
the usual arithmetic conversions (7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.arith.conv">expr.arith.conv</A>]) are
performed to bring them to a common type, and the result is of that
type.</LI>

(7.2.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.type">expr.type</A>]). The result is of the composite pointer
type.
