Forming a pointer to a reference type

<P>The Standard currently specifies (9.2.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.typedef#9">dcl.typedef</A>] paragraph 9,
13.4.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.arg.type#4">temp.arg.type</A>] paragraph 4) that an attempt to create a
reference to a reference (via a typedef or template type
parameter) is effectively ignored.  The same is not true of an attempt
to form a pointer to a reference; that is, assuming that <TT>T</TT> is
specified to be a reference type,</P>

<PRE>
    template &lt;typename T&gt; void f(T t) {
        T&amp; tr = t;   //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> OK</SPAN>
        T* tp = &amp;t;  //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> error</SPAN>
    }
</PRE>

<P>It would be more consistent to allow pointers to references to
collapse in the same way that references to references do.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (February, 2008):</B></P>

<P>In the absence of a compelling need, the CWG felt that it was
better not to change the existing rules.  Allowing this case could
cause a quiet change to the meaning of a program, because attempting
to create a pointer to a reference type is currently a deduction
failure.</P>

<P><B>Additional discussion (May, 2009):</B></P>

<P>Consider the following slightly extended version of the example
above:</P>

<PRE>
    template &lt;typename T&gt; void f(T t) {
        T&amp; tr = t;   // OK
        T* tp = &amp;t;  // error
        auto * ap = &amp;t; // OK!
    }
</PRE>

<P>This means that a template that expects a reference type will need
to use <TT>auto</TT> just to work around the failure to collapse
pointer-to-reference types.  The result might, in fact, be subtly
different with <TT>auto</TT>, as well, in case there is an overloaded
<TT>operator&amp;</TT> function that doesn't return exactly
<TT>T*</TT>.  This contradicts one of the main goals of C++0x, to make
it simpler, more consistent, and easier to teach.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (July, 2009):</B></P>

<P>The CWG reaffirmed its early decision.  In general, templates will
need to be written differently for reference and non-reference type
parameters.  Also, the Standard library provides a facility,
<TT>std::remove_reference</TT>, that can be used easily for such
cases.</P>
