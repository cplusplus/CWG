<P>[Moved to DR at the November, 2014 meeting.]</P>

<P>According to 6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr#3">basic.def.odr</A>] paragraph 3,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A function whose name appears as a potentially-evaluated expression is
odr-used if it is the unique lookup result or the selected member of a set
of overloaded functions (6.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lookup">basic.lookup</A>],
12.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.match">over.match</A>], 12.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.over">over.over</A>]), unless it is a pure
virtual function and its name is not explicitly qualified.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In the following example, consequently, <TT>S::f</TT> is odr-used but
not defined, and (because it is an undefined odr-used inline function) a
diagnostic is required:</P>

<PRE>
  namespace {
    struct S {
      inline virtual void f() = 0;
    };
   void (S::*p) = &amp;S::f;
  }
</PRE>

<P>However, <TT>S::f</TT> cannot be called through such a
pointer-to-member, so forming a pointer-to-member should not
cause a pure virtual function to be odr-used.  There is
implementation divergence on this point.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (April, 2013):</B></P>

<P>Change 6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr#3">basic.def.odr</A>] paragraph 3 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

...A virtual member function is odr-used if it is not pure. A function
whose name appears as a potentially-evaluated expression is odr-used if it
is the unique lookup result or the selected member of a set of overloaded
functions (6.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lookup">basic.lookup</A>], 12.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.match">over.match</A>],
12.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.over">over.over</A>]), unless it is a pure virtual function and
<INS>either</INS> its name is not explicitly qualified <INS>or the
expression forms a pointer to member (5.3.1)</INS>. [<I>Note:</I>...
