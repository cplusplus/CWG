<P>[Accepted as a DR at the March, 2024 meeting.]</P>



<P>In subclause 6.7.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.object#10">intro.object</A>] paragraph 10,
operations implicitly creating objects are defined:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Some operations are described as <I>implicitly creating objects</I>
within a specified region of storage. For each operation that is
specified as implicitly creating objects, that operation implicitly
creates and starts the lifetime of zero or more objects of
implicit-lifetime types (6.8.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.types.general">basic.types.general</A>]) in its specified
region of storage if...

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>However, the standard does not specify the storage duration that
such an implicitly-created object has; this new method of object
creation is not mentioned in 6.7.6.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.general#2">basic.stc.general</A>] paragraph 2:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Static, thread, and automatic storage durations are associated with
objects introduced by declarations (6.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def">basic.def</A>]) and
implicitly created by the implementation
(6.7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.temporary">class.temporary</A>]). The dynamic storage duration is
associated with objects created by a <I>new-expression</I>
(7.6.2.8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.new">expr.new</A>]).

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>With the exception of <TT>malloc</TT>, the storage duration should
probably be that of the object providing storage (if any), similar to
the provision for subobjects in 6.7.6.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.general">basic.stc.general</A>]:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The storage duration of subobjects and reference members is that of
their complete object (6.7.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.object">intro.object</A>]).

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The storage duration of an object created by a non-allocating form
of an allocation function (17.6.3.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/new.delete.placement">new.delete.placement</A>]) should be
treated similarly.</P>

<P><U>Possible resolution [SUPERSEDED]:</U></P>

<P>Change in 6.7.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.object#13">intro.object</A>] paragraph 13 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Any implicit or explicit invocation of a function named <TT>operator
new</TT> or <TT>operator new[]</TT> implicitly creates
objects <INS>with dynamic storage duration</INS> in the returned
region of storage and returns a pointer to a suitable created object.

implicitly created by the implementation
(6.7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.temporary">class.temporary</A>]). The dynamic storage duration is

allocation function (6.7.6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.dynamic.allocation">basic.stc.dynamic.allocation</A>]) other than a
non-allocating form (17.6.3.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/new.delete.placement">new.delete.placement</A>]) or by C library
memory allocation (20.2.12 [<A href="https://wg21.link/c.malloc">c.malloc</A>])</INS>.

allocation function</DEL> <INS>other than a non-allocating form</INS>
(17.6.3.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/new.delete.placement">new.delete.placement</A>]), the pointer returned on a successful

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The storage duration of <DEL>subobjects and</DEL> reference members is
that of their complete object<INS>. The storage duration of an object
nested within another object <I>x</I> is the storage duration
of <I>x</I></INS> (6.7.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.object">intro.object</A>]).

<P>Change in 7.6.2.8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.new#9">expr.new</A>] paragraph 9 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<INS>An object created by a <I>new-expression</I> that invokes an
allocation function with a non-allocating form (see below) has the
storage duration of the object that used to occupy the region of
storage where the new object is created.</INS>

<DEL>Objects</DEL> <INS>Any other object</INS> created by
a <I>new-expression</I> <DEL>have</DEL> <INS>has</INS>
dynamic storage duration (6.7.6.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.dynamic">basic.stc.dynamic</A>]).  [<I>Note
5:</I> The lifetime of such an object is not necessarily restricted to
the scope in which it is created. &#8212;<I>end note</I>]

<LI>
<P>Change in 20.2.12 [<A href="https://wg21.link/c.malloc#4">c.malloc</A>] paragraph 4 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

These functions implicitly create objects (6.7.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.object">intro.object</A>])
<INS>with dynamic storage duration</INS> in the returned region of
storage and return a pointer to a suitable created object. In the case
of calloc and realloc, the objects are created before the storage is
zeroed or copied, respectively.

<P><B>Additional note (December, 2023)</B></P>

<P>The approach outlined above is incomplete and the wrong direction.
The concept of storage duration determines when an object is created
and destroyed; for dynamic storage duration, the object is created and
destroyed by explicit program action.</P>
