<P>
Thus says the section
11.8.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.friend">class.friend</A>]/7 in ISO 14882 C++ standard:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A name nominated by a friend declaration shall be accessible
<U>in the scope of the class</U> containing the friend declaration.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The obvious intention of this is to allow a friend declaration to
specify a function (or nested class, enum, etc.) that is declared
"private" or "protected" in its enclosing class.  However, literal
interpretation seems to allow a broader access to the befriended
function by the whole class that is declaring the friendship.</P>

<P>If the rule were interpreted literally as it is currently written, this
would compile (when it, of course, shouldn't be allowed at all):</P>
<PRE>
class C
{
private:
  static void f();
};

class D
{
  friend void C::f();  // A name nominated by friend declaration...

  D()
  {
   C::f();  // ... shall be accessible in scope of class declaring friendship
  }
};
</PRE>

<P>Suggested fix is to reword "in the scope of the class containing
the friend declaration" to exclude all other references from the
scope of the declaring class, except the friend-declaration itself.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the March 2004 meeting:</B></P>

<P>We considered this and concluded that the standard is clear enough.</P>
