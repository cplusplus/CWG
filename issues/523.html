Can a one-past-the-end pointer be invalidated by deleting an adjacent object?

<P>When an object is deleted, 6.7.6.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation">basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation</A>] says
that the deallocation &#8220;[renders] invalid all pointers referring
to any part of the deallocated storage.&#8221; According to
6.8.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.compound#3">basic.compound</A>] paragraph 3, a pointer whose address is
one past the end of an array is considered to point to an unrelated
object that happens to reside at that address.  Does this need to be
clarified to specify that the one-past-the-end pointer of an array is
not invalidated by deleting the following object?  (See also
7.6.2.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.delete#4">expr.delete</A>] paragraph 4, which also mentions that
the system deallocation function renders a pointer invalid.)</P>
