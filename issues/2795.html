<P>[Accepted as a DR at the November, 2023 meeting.]</P>



<P>Subclause 6.7.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.object#9">intro.object</A>] paragraph 9 specifies:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

... Two objects with overlapping lifetimes that are not bit-fields may
have the same address if one is nested within the other, or if at
least one is a subobject of zero size and they are of different types;
otherwise, they have distinct addresses and occupy disjoint bytes of
storage. [ Footnote: ... ]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Types <TT>T</TT> and <TT>const T</TT> are different types, but it
is unlikely the rule is intending to differentiate along that
line.</P>

<P><U>Suggested resolution [SUPERSEDED]:</U></P>

<P>Change in 6.7.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.object#9">intro.object</A>] paragraph 9 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

... Two objects with overlapping lifetimes that are not bit-fields may
have the same address if one is nested within the other, or if at
least one is a subobject of zero size and they are of different types
<INS>(ignoring top-level cv-qualifiers)</INS>; otherwise, they have
distinct addresses and occupy disjoint bytes of storage. [ Footnote:
... ]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (approved by CWG 2023-09-15):</B></P>

<P>(Hypothetically, pointer-to-member types can be empty, but might
differ in non-top-level cv-qualification.)</P>

<P>Change in 6.7.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.object#9">intro.object</A>] paragraph 9 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

... Two objects with overlapping lifetimes that are not bit-fields may
have the same address if one is nested within the other, or if at
least one is a subobject of zero size and they are <INS>not</INS>
of <DEL>different</DEL> <INS>similar</INS>
types <INS>(7.3.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.qual">conv.qual</A>])</INS>; otherwise, they have
distinct addresses and occupy disjoint bytes of storage. [ Footnote:
... ]
