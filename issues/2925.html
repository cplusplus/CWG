<P>Paper
<A HREF="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p3144r2.pdf">P3144R2</A>
(Deleting a Pointer to an Incomplete Type Should be Ill-formed),
approved in June, 2024, only covered deletion of incomplete class
types.  However, enumeration types can also be incomplete per
9.7.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.enum#6">dcl.enum</A>] paragraph 6:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

An enumeration whose underlying type is fixed is an incomplete type
until immediately after its <I>enum-base</I> (if any), at which point
it becomes a complete type. An enumeration whose underlying type is
not fixed is an incomplete type until the closing } of
its <I>enum-specifier</I> , at which point it becomes a complete type.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This leads to the following example that ought to be ill-formed as well:</P>

<PRE>
  enum E {
    zero = decltype(delete static_cast&lt;E*&gt;(nullptr), 0){}
  };
</PRE>

<P><U>Suggested resolution:</U></P>

<P>Change in 7.6.2.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.delete#4">expr.delete</A>] paragraph 4 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If the <INS>static type of the</INS> object <DEL>being</DEL> <INS>to
be</INS> deleted has incomplete <DEL>class</DEL> type at the point of
deletion, the program is ill-formed.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>CWG 2024-09-13</B></P>

<P>Since an enumeration type can never have a user-declared
destructor, there is no risk of introducing undefined behavior that
would be prevented by making deletions involving incomplete
enumeration types ill-formed.  In short, the situation discussed in
this issue is harmless and thus lacks rationale to be made
ill-formed.</P>
