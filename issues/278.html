<P>It is unclear to what extent entities without names match
across translation units.  For example,</P>

<PRE>
    struct S {
       int :2;
       enum { a, b, c } x;
       static class {} *p;
    };
</PRE>

<P>If this declaration appears in multiple translation units, are
all these members "the same" in each declaration?</P>

<P>A similar question can be asked about non-member declarations:</P>

<PRE>
    // Translation unit 1:
    extern enum { d, e, f } y;

    // Translation unit 2:
    extern enum { d, e, f } y;

    // Translation unit 3:
    enum { d, e, f } y;
</PRE>

<P>Is this valid C++?  Is it valid C?</P>

<P>
<U>James Kanze</U>: <TT>S::p</TT> cannot be defined, because to
do so requires a type specifier and the type cannot be named.
<TT>::y</TT> is valid C because C only requires compatible, not
identical, types.  In C++, it appears that there is a new type in
each declaration, so it would not be valid.  This differs from
<TT>S::x</TT> because the unnamed type is part of a named type
&#8212; but I don't know where or if the Standard says that.</P>

<P>
<U>John Max Skaller</U>:
It's not valid C++, because the type is a synthesised, unique name
for the enumeration type which differs across translation units, as if:</P>

<PRE>
    extern enum _synth1 { d,e,f} y;
    ..
    extern enum _synth2 { d,e,f} y;
</PRE>

<P>had been written.</P>

<P>However, within a class, the ODR implies the types are the same:</P>

<PRE>
    class X { enum { d } y; };
</PRE>

<P>in two translation units ensures that the type of member <TT>y</TT>
is the same: the two <TT>X</TT>'s obey the ODR and so denote the same class,
and it follows that there's only one member <TT>y</TT> and one type that it
has.</P>

<P>(See also issues <A HREF="132.html">132</A> and
<A HREF="216.html">216</A>.)</P>

<P><B>Rationale (February, 2021):</B></P>

<P>The resolution of <A HREF="2300.html">issue 2300</A>
and paper P2115R0 have resolved these questions.</P>
