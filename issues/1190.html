<P>[Voted into the WP at the March, 2011 meeting as part of paper N3262.]</P>



<P>_N4885_6.7.5.5.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.dynamic.safety#4">basic.stc.dynamic.safety</A>] paragraph 4 only prohibits the
dereferencing and deallocation of non-safely-derived pointers. This is
insufficient.  Explicit deallocation of storage is described as
rendering invalid all pointers to that storage, with the result that
<I>all</I> operations on such a pointer value causes undefined
behavior (6.7.6.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation#4">basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation</A>] paragraph 4).  The same should
be true if the storage pointed to by a non-safely-derived pointer is
garbage collected.  In particular, the promise of objects having
distinct addresses (6.7.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.object#6">intro.object</A>] paragraph 6) should not
apply if one of those objects is designated by a non-safely-derived
pointer.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (November, 2010) [SUPERSEDED]:</B></P>

<P>Change _N4885_6.7.5.5.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.dynamic.safety#4">basic.stc.dynamic.safety</A>] paragraph 4 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

...Alternatively, an implementation may have <I>strict pointer
safety</I>, in which case, <DEL>if</DEL> a pointer value that is not a
safely-derived pointer value is <DEL>dereferenced or deallocated,
and</DEL> <INS>an invalid pointer value, unless</INS> the referenced
complete object is of dynamic storage duration and has <DEL>not</DEL>
previously been declared reachable (_N4700_.23.11.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/util.smartptr">util.smartptr</A>])<DEL>, the behavior is undefined</DEL>. [<I>Note:</I>
<DEL>this</DEL> <INS>The effect of using an invalid pointer value
(including passing it to a deallocation function) is undefined, see
6.7.6.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation">basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation</A>]. This</INS> is true even if the
unsafely-derived pointer value might compare equal to some
safely-derived pointer value. &#8212;<I>end note</I>] It is
implementation defined...
