<P>[Adopted at the October, 2015 meeting as P0136R1.]</P>

<P>Default arguments are a common mechanism for applying SFINAE to
constructors.  However, default arguments are not carried over
when base class constructors are inherited; instead, an overload
set of constructors with various numbers of arguments is created
in the derived class.  This seems problematic.</P>

<P>One possibility would be to change the mechanism for how
constructors are inherited; a <I>using-declaration</I> might
actually introduce the base class constructors into the derived
class, as other <I>using-declaration</I>s do, and if a base class
constructor were selected, the remaining derived class members
would be default-initialized.</P>

<P>This approach would also address issues <A HREF="1645.html">1645</A>, as duplicated constructors would simply fail during
overload resolution, and <A HREF="1715.html">1715</A>, since
there would be no synthesized constructors for which access
checking would be needed.</P>

<P>The effect of such an approach on ABIs, including mangling, would
need to be considered.</P>
