<P>[Accepted at the November, 2020 meeting as part of paper P1787R6 and
moved to DR at the February, 2021 meeting.]</P>

<P>It is not clear whether some of the wording in 9.11 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.link">dcl.link</A>]
that applies only to function types and names ought also to apply to
object names.  In particular, paragraph 3 says,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Every implementation shall provide for linkage to functions written in
the C programming language, <TT>"C"</TT>, and linkage to C++
functions, <TT>"C++"</TT>.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Nothing is said about variable names, apparently meaning that
implementations need not provide C (or even C++!) linkage for
variable names.  Also, paragraph 5 says,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Except for functions with C++ linkage, a function declaration without
a linkage specification shall not precede the first linkage
specification for that function. A function can be declared without a
linkage specification after an explicit linkage specification has been
seen; the linkage explicitly specified in the earlier declaration is
not affected by such a function declaration.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>There doesn't seem to be a good reason for these provisions not
to apply to variable names, as well.</P>
