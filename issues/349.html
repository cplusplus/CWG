<P>[Voted into WP at October 2003 meeting.]</P>



<P>We ran into an issue concerning qualification conversions when doing
template argument deduction for conversion functions.</P>

<P>The question is: What is the type of T in the conversion functions
called by this example?  Is T "int" or "const int"?</P>

<P>If T is "int", the conversion function in class A works and the one in
class B fails (because the return expression cannot be converted to
the return type of the function).  If T is "const int", A fails and B
works.</P>

<P>Because the qualification conversion is performed on the result of the
conversion function, I see no benefit in deducing T as const int.</P>

<P>In addition, I think the code in class A is more likely to occur than
the code in class B.  If the author of the class was planning on returning
a pointer to a const entity, I would expect the function to have been
written with a const in the return type.</P>

<P>Consequently, I believe the correct result should be that T is int.</P>
<PRE>
struct A {
	template &lt;class T&gt; operator T***() {
		int*** p = 0;
		return p;
	}
};

struct B {
	template &lt;class T&gt; operator T***() {
		const int*** p = 0;
		return p;
	}
};

int main()
{
	A a;
	const int * const * const * p1 = a;
	B b;
	const int * const * const * p2 = b;
}
</PRE>
<P>We have just implemented this feature, and pending clarification by
the committee, we deduce T as int.  It appears that g++ and the Sun
compiler deduce T as const int.</P>

<P>One way or the other, I think the standard should be clarified to
specify how cases like this should be handled.</P>

<P><B>Notes from October 2002 meeting:</B></P>

<P>There was consensus on having the deduced type be "int" in the
above.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (April 2003):</B></P>

<P>
Add to the end of 13.10.3.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.deduct.conv">temp.deduct.conv</A>] (as a new paragraph
following paragraph 3):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When the deduction process requires a qualification conversion for a
pointer or pointer to member type as described above, the following
process is used to determine the deduced template argument values:</P>

<P> If <TT>A</TT> is a type <I>cv</I><SUB>1,0</SUB> pointer to ... <I>cv</I>
<SUB>1,<I>n</I>-1</SUB>
pointer to <I>cv</I><SUB>1,<I>n</I></SUB> <I>T1</I>
</P>
<P> and <TT>P</TT> is a type <I>cv</I><SUB>2,0</SUB>
pointer to ... <I>cv</I><SUB>2,<I>n</I>-1</SUB>
pointer to <I>cv</I><SUB>2,<I>n</I></SUB> <I>T2</I>
</P>
<P> The cv-unqualified T1 and T2 are used as the types of
<TT>A</TT> and <TT>P</TT> respectively for type deduction.</P>

<P>
[<I>Example:</I>
<PRE>
struct A {
	template &lt;class T&gt; operator T***();
};

A a;
const int * const * const * p1 = a;  // T is deduced as int, not const int
</PRE>
