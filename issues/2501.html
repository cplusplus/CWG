<P>CWG determined that <A HREF="2488.html">issue 2488</A>
was not a defect. However, the discussion uncovered an issue
regarding the handling of an explicit instantiation of a
class template containing such members. According to
13.9.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.explicit#10">temp.explicit</A>] paragraph 10,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

An explicit instantiation that names a class template
specialization is also an explicit instantiation of the same
kind (declaration or definition) of each of its direct
non-template members that has not been previously explicitly
specialized in the translation unit containing the explicit
instantiation, provided that the associated constraints, if
any, of that member are satisfied by the template arguments
of the explicit instantiation (13.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.constr.decl">temp.constr.decl</A>],
13.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.constr.constr">temp.constr.constr</A>]), except as described below.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Paragraph 12 says,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

An explicit instantiation of a prospective destructor
(11.4.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.dtor">class.dtor</A>]) shall correspond to the
selected destructor of the class.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Perhaps the virtual and constrained members could be
handled in an analogous fashion.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the November, 2021 teleconference:</B></P>

<P>
<A HREF="2488.html">Issue 2488</A> is being reopened
due to subsequent comments. </P>

<P><B>CWG 2022-11-10</B></P>

<P>For each explicit instantiation, there shall be exactly one member
whose constraints are more specialized than any other member with the
same signature.  Use the "address of function" model to determine this
member.</P>
