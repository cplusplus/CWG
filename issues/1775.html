<P>[Moved to DR at the February, 2014 meeting.]</P>

<P>According to phase 2 of 5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.phases#1">lex.phases</A>] paragraph 1,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Each instance of a backslash character (<TT>\</TT>) immediately followed by
a new-line character is deleted, splicing physical source lines to form
logical source lines. Only the last backslash on any physical source line
shall be eligible for being part of such a splice. If, as a result, a
character sequence that matches the syntax of a universal-character-name is
produced, the behavior is undefined.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>There does not appear to be a good reason for the behavior to be
undefined when the line splice occurs within a raw string literal, since
the splicing will be reverted (5.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.pptoken#3">lex.pptoken</A>] paragraph 3).</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (September, 2013):</B></P>

<P>Change 5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.phases#1">lex.phases</A>] paragraph 1 phase 2 as follows:</P>

<OL start="2">
<LI>

<P>Each instance of a backslash character (<TT>\</TT>) immediately followed
by a new-line character is deleted, splicing physical source lines to form
logical source lines. Only the last backslash on any physical source line
shall be eligible for being part of such a splice. <DEL>If, as a
result,</DEL> <INS>Except for splices reverted in a raw string literal, if
a splice results in</INS> a character sequence that matches the syntax of a
universal-character-name <DEL>is produced</DEL>, the behavior is
undefined. A source file that is not empty and that does not end in a
new-line character, or that ends in a new-line character immediately
preceded by a backslash character before any such splicing takes place,
shall be processed as if an additional new-line character were appended to
the file.</P>
</LI>
