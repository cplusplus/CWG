<P>[Voted into WP at the October, 2006 meeting.]</P>

<P>Is the following code well-formed?</P>

<PRE>
    namespace N {
      int i;
      extern int j;
    }
    int N::j = i;
</PRE>

<P>The question here is whether the lookup for <TT>i</TT> in the
initializer of <TT>N::j</TT> finds the declaration in namespace
<TT>N</TT> or not.  Implementations differ on this question.</P>

<P>If <TT>N::j</TT> were a static data member of a class, the
answer would be clear: both 6.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lookup.unqual#12">basic.lookup.unqual</A>] paragraph 12
and 9.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init#11">dcl.init</A>] paragraph 11 say that
the initializer &#8220;is in the scope of the member's
class.&#8221;  There is no such provision for namespace
members defined outside the namespace, however.</P>

<P>The reasoning given in 6.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lookup.unqual">basic.lookup.unqual</A>] may be
instructive:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A name used in the definition of a <TT>static</TT> data member of
class <TT>X</TT> (11.4.9.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.static.data">class.static.data</A>]) (after the
<I>qualified-id</I> of the static member) is looked up as if the name
was used in a member function of <TT>X</TT>.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It is certainly the case that a name used in a function that is
a member of a namespace is looked up in that namespace
(6.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lookup.unqual#6">basic.lookup.unqual</A>] paragraph 6), regardless of whether
the definition is inside or outside that namespace.  Initializers
for namespace members should probably be looked up the same way.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (April, 2006):</B></P>

<P>Add a new paragraph following 6.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lookup.unqual#12">basic.lookup.unqual</A>] paragraph 12:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If a variable member of a namespace is defined outside of the scope
of its namespace then any name used in the definition of the variable
member (after the <I>declarator-id</I>) is looked up as if the
definition of the variable member occurred in its
namespace. [<I>Example:</I>
</P>

<PRE>
    namespace N {
      int i = 4;
      extern int j;
    }

    int i = 2;

    int N::j = i;	//<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> </SPAN>N::j<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> == 4</SPAN>
</PRE>

<P>&#8212;<I>end example</I>]</P>
