<P>[Voted into WP at April 2005 meeting.]</P>

<P>There seems to be a typo in
6.7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.temporary">class.temporary</A>]/5, which says "The temporary to which
the reference is bound or the temporary that is the complete object TO a
subobject OF which the TEMPORARY is bound persists for the lifetime of the
reference except as specified below."</P>

<P>I think this should be "The temporary to which the reference is bound or the
temporary that is the complete object OF a subobject TO which the REFERENCE
is bound persists for the lifetime of the reference except as specified
below."</P>

<P>I used upper-case letters for the parts I think need to be
changed.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (October, 2004):</B></P>

<P>Change 6.7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.temporary#5">class.temporary</A>] paragraph 5 as
indicated:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The temporary to which the reference is bound or the temporary
that is the complete object <DEL>to</DEL> <INS>of</INS> a subobject
<DEL>of</DEL> <INS>to</INS> which the <DEL>temporary</DEL> <INS>reference</INS>
is bound persists for the lifetime of the reference except as
specified below.
