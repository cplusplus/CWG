<P>[Accepted at the November, 2022 meeting.]</P>

<P>Translation phases 2 and 3 assume that lines are terminated by
"new-line characters". However, the current specification of phase 1
does not guarantee that to be true. In particular, for a UTF-8 file
the verbatim sequence of source file characters forms the input for
phase 2, even on systems where the line terminator is a carriage
return. The non-UTF-8 specification is also defective in that it
speaks of "introducing" new-line characters, even for encodings like
Latin-1 where new-lines might already be present and no "introduction"
is needed or appropriate.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution [SUPERSEDED]:</B></P>

<P>Change in 5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.phases#1.1">lex.phases</A>] paragraph 1.1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
...  If an input file is determined to be a UTF-8 file, then it shall
be a well-formed UTF-8 code unit sequence and it is decoded to produce
a sequence of UCS scalar values that constitutes the sequence of
elements of the translation character set<INS>, representing each
line-termination character or character sequence as a new-line
character</INS>.
</P>

<P>
For any other kind of input file supported by the implementation,
characters are mapped, in an implementation-defined manner, to a
sequence of translation character set elements
(5.3.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.charset">lex.charset</A>]) (<DEL>introducing new-line characters
for</DEL> <INS>representing</INS> end-of-line indicators <INS>as
new-line characters</INS>).

sequence, each pair of characters in the input sequence consisting of U+000D
CARRIAGE RETURN followed by U+000A LINE FEED, as well as each U+000D
CARRIAGE RETURN not immediately followed by a U+000A LINE FEED, is
replaced by a single new-line character.</INS>
