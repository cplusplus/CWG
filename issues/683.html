<P>[Voted into the WP at the September, 2008 meeting (resolution
in paper N2757).]</P>



<P>Part of the decision regarding whether a class has a trivial special
function (copy constructor, copy assignment operator, default constructor)
is whether its base and member subobjects have corresponding trivial
member functions.  However, with the advent of defaulted functions, it is
now possible for a single class to have both trivial and nontrivial
overloads for those functions.  For example,</P>

<PRE>
    struct B {
       B(B&amp;) = default;    //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> trivial</SPAN>
       B(const B&amp;);        //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> non-trivial, because user-provided</SPAN>
    };

    struct D : B { };
</PRE>

<P>Although <TT>B</TT> has <I>a</I> trivial copy constructor and thus
satisfies the requirements in 11.4.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.ctor#6">class.copy.ctor</A>] paragraph 6,
the copy constructor in <TT>B</TT> that would be called by the
implicitly-declared copy constructor in <TT>D</TT> is <I>not</I>
trivial.  This could be fixed either by requiring that all the
subobject's copy constructors (or copy assignment operators, or
default constructors) be trivial or that the one that would be
selected by overload resolution be trivial.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (July, 2008):</B></P>

<P>Change 9.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct.def#9">dcl.fct.def</A>] paragraph 9 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

... A special member function that would be implicitly defined as
deleted shall not be explicitly defaulted. <INS>If a special member
function for a class <TT>X</TT> is defaulted on its first declaration,
no other special member function of the same kind (default
constructor, copy constructor, or copy assignment operator) shall be
declared in class <TT>X</TT>.</INS> A special member function is
<I>user-provided</I>...

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Notes from the September, 2008 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The resolution adopted as part of paper N2757 differs from the
July, 2008 proposed resolution by allowing defaulted and
user-provided special member functions to coexist.  Instead, a
trivial class is defined as having no non-trivial copy constructors
or copy assignment operators, and a trivial copy constructor or
assignment operator is defined as invoking only trivial copy
operations for base and member subobjects.</P>
