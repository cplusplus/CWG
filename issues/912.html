<P>[Moved to DR at the October, 2012 meeting.]</P>

<P>According to 5.13.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.ccon#1">lex.ccon</A>] paragraph 1,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A character literal that does not begin with <TT>u</TT>, <TT>U</TT>,
or <TT>L</TT> is an ordinary character literal, also referred to as a
narrow-character literal.  An ordinary character literal that contains
a single <I>c-char</I> has type <TT>char</TT>, with value equal to the
numerical value of the encoding of the c-char in the execution
character set.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>However, the definition of <I>c-char</I> includes as one
possibility a <I>universal-character-name</I>.  The value of a
<I>universal-character-name</I> cannot, in general, be represented
as a <TT>char</TT>, so this specification is impossible to
satisfy.</P>

<P>(See also <A HREF="411.html">issue 411</A> for related
questions.)</P>

<P><B>Additional note (February, 2012):</B></P>

<P>See the discussion in <A HREF="1422.html">issue 1422</A> for a
possible interpretation of the existing text.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (February, 2012):</B></P>

<P>Change 5.13.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.ccon#1">lex.ccon</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

...A character literal that does not begin with <TT>u</TT>,
<TT>U</TT>, or <TT>L</TT> is an ordinary character literal, also
referred to as a narrow-character literal.  An ordinary character
literal that contains a single <I>c-char</I> <INS>representable in
the execution character set</INS> has type <TT>char</TT>,
with value equal to the numerical value of the encoding of the
<I>c-char</I> in the execution character set. An ordinary character
literal that contains more than one <I>c-char</I> is a
<I>multicharacter literal</I>.  A multicharacter literal<INS>, or an
ordinary character literal containing a single <I>c-char</I> not
representable in the execution character set, is
conditionally-supported,</INS> has type <TT>int</TT><INS>,</INS> and
<INS>has an</INS> implementation-defined value.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This resolution also resolves <A HREF="1024.html">issue 1024</A>.</P>
