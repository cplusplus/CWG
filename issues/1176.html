<P>The current wording of the standard suggests
that release sequences are maximal with respect to
sequence inclusion, i.e. that if there are two release
operations in the modification order,</P>

<PRE>
mod       mod
rel1-----&gt;rel2-----&gt;w
</PRE>

<P>then <TT>[rel1;rel2;w]</TT> is the only release sequence, as the
other candidate <TT>[rel2;w]</TT> is included in it. This
interpretation precludes synchronizing with releases which have other
releases sequenced-before them. We believe that the intention is
actually to define the maximal release sequence from a particular
release operation, which would admit both <TT>[rel1;rel2;w]</TT> and
<TT>[rel2;w]</TT>.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (August, 2010):</B></P>

<P>Change 6.9.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.multithread#6">intro.multithread</A>] paragraph 6 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>A <I>release sequence</I> <INS>from a release operation
<I>A</I></INS> on an atomic object <I>M</I> is a maximal contiguous
sub-sequence of side effects in the modification order of
<I>M</I>, where the first operation is <DEL>a release</DEL>
<INS><I>A</I></INS>, and every subsequent operation</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>is performed by the same thread that performed the release,
or</P></LI>

<LI><P>is an atomic read-modify-write operation.</P></LI>

</UL>
