<P>[Accepted as a DR at the June, 2024 meeting.]</P>

<P>(From submission
<A HREF="https://github.com/cplusplus/CWG/issues/497">#497</A>.)</P>

<P>Base-to-derived casts and cross-casts need to inspect the vtable of
a polymorphic type.  However, this is not defined as an "access" and
there is no provision for undefined behavior analoguous to
7.2.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lval#11">basic.lval</A>] paragraph 11.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (approved by CWG 2024-06-26):</B></P>

<OL>
<LI>
<P>Add a new paragraph after 7.6.1.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.dynamic.cast#6">expr.dynamic.cast</A>] paragraph 6 as
follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If v is a null pointer value, the result is a null pointer value.</P>

<P class="ins">
If <TT>v</TT> has type "pointer to <I>cv</I> <TT>U</TT>"
and <TT>v</TT> does not point to an object whose type is similar
(7.3.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.qual">conv.qual</A>]) to <TT>U</TT> and that is within its
lifetime or within its period of construction or destruction
(11.9.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.cdtor">class.cdtor</A>]), the behavior is undefined.
If <TT>v</TT> is a glvalue of type <TT>U</TT> and <TT>v</TT> does not
refer to an object whose type is similar to <TT>U</TT> and that is
within its lifetime or within its period of construction or
destruction, the behavior is undefined.
</P>

<LI>
<P>Change in 7.3.12 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.ptr#3">conv.ptr</A>] paragraph 3 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A prvalue <INS><TT>v</TT></INS> of type &#8220;pointer to cv D&#8221;,
where D is a complete class type, can be converted to a prvalue of
type &#8220;pointer to cv B&#8221;, where B is a base class
(11.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.derived">class.derived</A>]) of D. If B is an inaccessible
(11.8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.access">class.access</A>]) or ambiguous (6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.member.lookup">class.member.lookup</A>])
base class of D, a program that necessitates this conversion is
ill-formed. <DEL>The result of the conversion is a pointer to the base
class subobject of the derived class object. The null pointer value is
converted to the null pointer value of the destination type.</DEL>
<INS>If <TT>v</TT> is a null pointer value, the result is a null
pointer value.  Otherwise, if <TT>B</TT> is a virtual base class
of <TT>D</TT> and <TT>v</TT> does not point to an object whose type is
similar (7.3.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.qual">conv.qual</A>]) to <TT>D</TT> and that is within
its lifetime or within its period of construction or destruction
(11.9.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.cdtor">class.cdtor</A>]), the behavior is undefined. Otherwise,
the result is a pointer to the base class subobject of the derived
class object.</INS>
