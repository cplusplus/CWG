<P>[Moved to DR at the October, 2015 meeting.]</P>

<P>It is not clear that the odr-use of a virtual function described in
6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr#3">basic.def.odr</A>] paragraph 3 is exempt from the prohibition
against referring to a deleted function (9.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct.def.delete#2">dcl.fct.def.delete</A>] paragraph 2)
.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (May, 2015):</B></P>

<P>Change 9.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct.def.delete#2">dcl.fct.def.delete</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A program that refers to a deleted function implicitly or
explicitly, other than to declare it, is ill-formed.
[<I>Note:</I> This includes calling the function implicitly
or explicitly and forming a pointer or pointer-to-member to
the function. It applies even for references in expressions
that are not potentially-evaluated. If a function is
overloaded, it is referenced only if the function is
selected by overload resolution. <INS>The implicit odr-use
(6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr">basic.def.odr</A>]) of a virtual function does not, by
itself, constitute a reference.</INS> &#8212;<I>end note</I>]
