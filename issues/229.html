<P>Library issue 225 poses the following questions:</P>

<OL>

<LI>How can a 3rd party library implementor (lib1) write a version of
a standard algorithm which is specialized to work with his own class
template? </LI>

<LI>How can another library implementor (lib2) write a generic
algorithm which will take advantage of the specialized algorithm in
lib1?</LI>

</OL>

<P>For example, a programmer might want to provide a version of
<TT>std::swap</TT> that would be used for any specialization of a
particular class template.  It is possible to do that for specific
types, but not for all specializations of a template.</P>

<P>The problem is due to the fact that programmers are forbidden to
add overloads to namespace <TT>std</TT>, although specializations are
permitted.  One suggested solution would be to allow partial
specialization of function templates, analogous to partial
specialization of class templates.</P>

<P>Library issue 225 contains a detailed proposal for adding partial
specialization of function templates (not reproduced here in the
interest of space and avoiding multiple-copy problems).  This Core
issue is being opened to provide for discussion of the proposal within
the core language working group.</P>

<P><B>Notes from 10/00 meeting:</B></P>

<P>A major concern over the idea of partial specialization of
function templates is that function templates can be overloaded,
unlike class templates.  Simply naming the function template in
the specialization, as is done for class specialization, is not
adequate to identify the template being specialized.</P>

<P>In view of this problem, the library working group is exploring
the other alternative, permitting overloads to be added to functions
in namespace <TT>std</TT>, as long as certain restrictions (to be
determined) are satisfied.</P>

<P>(See also documents N1295 and N1296 and
<A HREF="285.html">issue 285</A>.)</P>

<P><B>Notes from 10/01 meeting:</B></P>

<P> The Core Working Group decided to ask the Library Working Group
for guidance on whether this feature is still needed to resolve a
library issue.  The answer at present is "we don't know."</P>

<P><B>Rationale (October, 2004):</B></P>

<P>The Core Working Group decided that the Evolution Working Group is
the appropriate forum in which to explore the desirability and form of
this feature.</P>

<P><B>Note (March, 2008):</B></P>

<P>The Evolution Working Group recommended closing this issue with no
further consideration.  See paper J16/07-0033 = WG21 N2173.</P>
