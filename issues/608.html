<P>[Voted into WP at October, 2009 meeting.]</P>

<P>According to 11.7.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.virtual#2">class.virtual</A>] paragraph 2:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Then in any well-formed class, for each virtual function declared
in that class or any of its direct or indirect base classes there
is a unique <I>final overrider</I> that overrides that function
and every other overrider of that function. The rules for member
lookup (6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.member.lookup">class.member.lookup</A>]) are used to determine the
final overrider for a virtual function in the scope of a derived
class but ignoring names introduced by <I>using-declaration</I>s.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I think that description is wrong on at least a couple of
counts.  First, consider the following example:</P>

<PRE>
    struct A { virtual void f(); };
    struct B: A { };
    struct C: A { void f(); };
    struct D: B, C { };
</PRE>

<P>What is the &#8220;unique final overrider&#8221; of
<TT>A::f()</TT> in <TT>D</TT>?  According to
11.7.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.virtual#2">class.virtual</A>] paragraph 2, we determine that by
looking up <TT>f</TT> in <TT>D</TT> using the lookup rules in
6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.member.lookup">class.member.lookup</A>].  However, that lookup determines that
<TT>f</TT> in <TT>D</TT> is ambiguous, so there is no
&#8220;unique final overrider&#8221; of <TT>A::f()</TT> in
<TT>D</TT>.  Consequently, because &#8220;any well-formed
class&#8221; must have such an overrider, <TT>D</TT> must be
ill-formed.</P>

<P>Of course, we all know that <TT>D</TT> is <I>not</I>
ill-formed.  In fact, 11.7.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.virtual#10">class.virtual</A>] paragraph 10
contains an example that illustrates exactly this point:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>
struct A {
    virtual void f();
};
struct B1 : A {     //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> note non-virtual derivation</SPAN>
    void f();
};
struct B2 : A {
    void f();
};
struct D : B1, B2 { //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> </SPAN>D<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> has two separate </SPAN>A<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> subobjects</SPAN>
};
</PRE>

<P>In class <TT>D</TT> above there are two occurrences of
class <TT>A</TT> and hence two occurrences of the virtual member
function <TT>A::f</TT>.  The final overrider of <TT>B1::A::f</TT>
is <TT>B1::f</TT> and the final overrider of <TT>B2::A::f</TT>
is <TT>B2::f</TT>.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It appears that the requirement for a &#8220;unique final
overrider&#8221; in 11.7.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.virtual#2">class.virtual</A>] paragraph 2 needs
to say something about sub-objects.  Whatever that
&#8220;something&#8221; is, you can't just say &#8220;look up the
name in the derived class using 6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.member.lookup">class.member.lookup</A>].&#8221;</P>

<P>There's another problem with using the 6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.member.lookup">class.member.lookup</A>]
lookup to specify the final overrider: name lookup just looks up the
name, while the overriding relationship is based not only on the name
but on a matching parameter-type-list and cv-qualification.  To
illustrate this point:</P>

<PRE>
    struct X {
        virtual void f();
    };
    struct Y: X {
        void f(int);
    };
    struct Z: Y { };
</PRE>

<P>What is the &#8220;unique final overrider&#8221; of
<TT>X::f()</TT> in <TT>A</TT>?  Again, 11.7.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.virtual#2">class.virtual</A>] paragraph 2
says you're supposed to look up <TT>f</TT> in
<TT>Z</TT> to find it; however, what you find is
<TT>Y::f(int)</TT>, not <TT>X::f()</TT>, and that's clearly
wrong.</P>

<P><B>Proposed Resolution (December, 2006):</B></P>

<P>Change 11.7.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.virtual#2">class.virtual</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
