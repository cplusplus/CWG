<P>According to 15.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/cpp.cond#12">cpp.cond</A>] paragraph 12,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The resulting tokens comprise the controlling constant expression
which is evaluated according to the rules of 7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.const">expr.const</A>]
using arithmetic that has at least the ranges specified in
17.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/support.limits">support.limits</A>], except that all signed and unsigned integer
types act as if they have the same representation as, respectively,
<TT>intmax_t</TT> or <TT>uintmax_t</TT> (_N3035_.18.4.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/stdinth">stdinth</A>]).
This includes interpreting character literals, which may involve
converting escape sequences into execution character set members.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Ordinary character literals with a single <I>c-char</I> have the
type <TT>char</TT>, which is neither a signed nor an unsigned integer
type. Although 7.3.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.prom#1">conv.prom</A>] paragraph 1 is clear that
<TT>char</TT> values promote to <TT>int</TT>, regardless of whether
the implementation treats <TT>char</TT> as having the values of
<TT>signed char</TT> or <TT>unsigned char</TT>, 15.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/cpp.cond#12">cpp.cond</A>] paragraph 12 isn't clear on whether character literals
should be treated as signed or unsigned values.  In C99, such
literals have type <TT>int</TT>, so the question does not arise.
If an implementation in which plain <TT>char</TT> has the values of
<TT>unsigned char</TT> were to treat character literals as unsigned,
an expression like <TT>'0'-'1'</TT> would thus have different values
in C and C++, namely -1 in C and some large unsigned value in C++.</P>
