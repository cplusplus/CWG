<P>(From item JP 03 of the Japanese National Body comments on the C++14
DIS ballot.)</P>

<P>A digit separator is allowed immediately following the
prefix for an octal literal but not for a binary or
hexadecimal literal.  For example, <TT>0'01</TT> is
permitted but <TT>0b'01</TT> and <TT>0x'01</TT> are not.
This asymmetry makes tools such as automatic code generators
more complicated than necessary.  The digit separator should
be consistently allowed or disallowed immediately following
the prefix in all non-decimal integer literals.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (November, 2014):</B></P>

<P>CWG felt that the reported asymmetry is not a major difficulty
and that it is more natural to think of the leading <TT>0</TT> in
an octal literal as part of the numeric value rather than as a
separate prefix, as it is with <TT>0b</TT> and <TT>0x</TT>.
Consequently there was no consensus for a change to the existing
specification.</P>
