<P>The consensus at the Pittsburgh (March, 2010) meeting, as reflected in
the adoption of paper N3050, was that it was preferable for violation of
a <TT>noexcept</TT> guarantee to call <TT>std::terminate</TT>; previous
versions of the paper had called for undefined behavior in this case.
Not everyone was convinced that this was a good decision, however; this
issue is intended to facilitate further investigation and discussion of
the question with the benefit of more time and resources than were
available during the deliberations at the meeting.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (August, 2010):</B></P>

<P>CWG reaffirmed the explicit decision of the Committee.</P>
