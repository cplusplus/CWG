<P>[Accepted as a DR at the November, 2023 meeting.]</P>



<P>Subclause 6.7.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.object#9">intro.object</A>] paragraph 9 specifies the general
principle that two objects with overlapping lifetimes have
non-overlapping storage, which can be observed by comparing
addresses:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Unless an object is a bit-field or a subobject of zero size, the
address of that object is the address of the first byte it
occupies. Two objects with overlapping lifetimes that are not
bit-fields may have the same address if one is nested within the
other, or if at least one is a subobject of zero size and they are of
different types; otherwise, they have distinct addresses and occupy
disjoint bytes of storage.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>After P2752, there are two exceptions: string literal objects and
backing arrays for initializer lists.</P>

<P>Subclause 5.13.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.string#9">lex.string</A>] paragraph 9 specifies:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Evaluating a <I>string-literal</I> results in a string literal object
with static storage duration (6.7.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc">basic.stc</A>]). Whether
all <I>string-literal</I>s are distinct (that is, are stored in
nonoverlapping objects) and whether successive evaluations of
a <I>string-literal</I> yield the same or a different object is
unspecified.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Subclause 9.4.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.ref#5">dcl.init.ref</A>] paragraph 5, after application of P2752R3 (approved in June, 2023), specifies:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Whether all backing arrays are distinct (that is, are stored in
non-overlapping objects) is unspecified.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It is unclear whether a backing array can overlap with a string
literal object.</P>

<P>Furthermore, it is unclear whether any such object can overlap with
named objects or temporaries, for example:</P>

<PRE>
  const char (&amp;r) [] = "foo";
  const char a[] = {'f', 'o', 'o', '\0'};

  int main() {  
    assert(&amp;r == &amp;a);   // allowed not to fail?
  }
</PRE>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (approved by CWG 2023-11-09):</B></P>

<OL>

<LI>
<P>Add a new paragraph before 6.7.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.object#9">intro.object</A>] paragraph 9 and
change the latter as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P class="ins">
An object is a <I>potentially non-unique object</I> if it is a string literal
object (5.13.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.string">lex.string</A>]), the backing array of an
initializer list (9.4.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.ref">dcl.init.ref</A>]), or a subobject thereof.
</P>

<P>Unless an object is a bit-field or a subobject of zero size, the
address of that object is the address of the first byte it
occupies. Two objects with overlapping lifetimes that are not
bit-fields may have the same address if one is nested within the
other, or if at least one is a subobject of zero size and they are of
different types<INS>, or if they are both potentially non-unique objects</INS>;
otherwise, they have distinct addresses and occupy disjoint bytes of
storage.</P>

<P>[Example 2:</P>

<PRE>
  static const char test1 = 'x';
  static const char test2 = 'x';
  const bool b = &amp;test1 != &amp;test2;  //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> always true</SPAN>

<INS>  static const char (&amp;r) [] = "x";
  static const char *s = "x";  
  static std::initializer_list&lt;char&gt; il = { 'x' };
  const bool b2 = r != il.begin();        //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> unspecified result</SPAN>
  const bool b3 = r != s;                 //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> unspecified result</SPAN>
  const bool b4 = il.begin() != &amp;test1;   //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> always </SPAN>true
  const bool b5 = r != &amp;test1;            //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> always </SPAN>true</INS>
</PRE>

<P><B>CWG 2023-07-14</B></P>

<P>CWG resolved that a named or temporary object is always disjoint
from any other object, and thus cannot overlap with a string literal
object or a backing array.  The lines <TT>b4</TT> and <TT>b5</TT> in the example
highlight that outcome.</P>

<P>Backing arrays and string literals can arbitrarily overlap among
themselves; CWG believes the proposed wording achieves that
outcome.</P>

<P>The ancillary question how address comparisons between potentially
non-unique objects are treated during constant evaluation is handled
in <A HREF="2765.html">issue 2765</A>.</P>
