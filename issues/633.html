<P>[Voted into WP at March, 2010 meeting as document N2993.]</P>

<P>There are a number of specifications in the Standard that should
also apply to references.  For example:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>6.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.pre">basic.pre</A>] paragraphs 3-4 indicate that a reference
cannot have a name because it is not an entity.  (See also
<A HREF="485.html">issue 485</A>.)</P></LI>

<LI><P>6.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lookup.unqual#13">basic.lookup.unqual</A>] paragraph 13 covers unqualified
lookup in the initializer of a variable member of a namespace but not
that of a reference member of a namespace.  It would be very strange
if the lookup in these two cases were different.</P></LI>

<LI><P>6.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.link#8">basic.link</A>] paragraph 8 prohibits use of a type
without linkage as the type of a variable with linkage, but not as the
type of a reference with linkage.  (References with linkage are
explicitly mentioned earlier in the section.)</P></LI>

<LI><P>6.7.6.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.static#3">basic.stc.static</A>] paragraph 3 permits local static
variables but not local static references.</P></LI>

</UL>

<P>A number of other examples could be cited.  A thorough review
is needed to make sure that references are completely
specified.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the September, 2008 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The CWG expressed interest in an approach that would define
&#8220;variable&#8221; to include both objects and references and
to use that for both this issue and <A HREF="570.html">issue 570</A>.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (October, 2009):</B></P>

<P>See paper PL22.16/09-0183 = WG21 N2993.  This resolution also resolves
<A HREF="570.html">issue 570</A>.</P>
