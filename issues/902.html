In-class initialization of non-constant static data members

<P>The current wording of 11.4.9.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.static.data">class.static.data</A>] only allows a
static data member to be initialized within the class definition if it
is <TT>const</TT>.  This restriction should be removed.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (July, 2009):</B></P>

<P>The consensus of the CWG was that there is insufficient motivation
for such a change.  A non-const static data member must still be
defined outside the class if it is used, and the value of such a
member cannot be used in a constant expression, unlike a constant
static data member, so there is no real advantage to putting the
initializer inside the class definition instead of in the definition
of the static data member.  The apparent parallel with non-static data
member initialization is also not compelling; for example, the
initializer for a non-static data member can contain forward
references to members declared later in the class, while the same is
not true of static data member initializers.</P>
