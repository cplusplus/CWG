<P>According to 6.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.pre#6">basic.pre</A>] paragraph 6,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A <I>variable</I> is introduced by the declaration of a reference other than
a non-static data member or of an object.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In other words, non-static data members of reference type are not
variables.  This complicates the wording in a number of places, where
the text refers to &#8220;variable or data member,&#8221; presumably to
cover the reference case, but that phrasing could lead to the mistaken
impression that all data members are not variables.  It would be better
if either there were a term for the current phrase &#8220;variable or
data member&#8221; or if there were a less-unwieldy term for
&#8220;non-static data member of reference type&#8221; that could be
used in place of &#8220;data member&#8221; in the current phrasing.</P>
