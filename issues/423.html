<P>Is the following well-formed?</P>
<PRE>
  template &lt;typename T&gt;
  class test
  {
  public:
    operator T&amp; (){ return m_i; }
  private:
    T m_i;
  };
  int main()
  {
    test&lt;int*&gt; t2;
    t2 += 1;  // Allowed?
  }
</PRE>
<P>Is it possible that by "assignment operators"
(12.2.2.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.match.oper#4">over.match.oper</A>] paragraph 4) only the built-in
candidates for operator= (i.e. excluding +=, *=, etc.) were meant? On one hand
the plural ("operators") seems to imply that all the assignment operators are
considered. OTOH, there has already been a core DR (221) about a missing
distinction between "assignment operator" and "compound assignment operators".
Is there a similar defect here?</P>

<P>
<U>Steve Adamczyk:</U>
The standard is ambiguous.  However,
I think the ARM was fairly clear about "assignment operators" meaning only
"=", and I find that Cfront 3.0.1 accepts the test case (with typename
changed to class).  I don't know whether that's good or bad, but it's
at least a precedent.  Given the change of
<A HREF="221.html">Core Issue 221</A>, if we do nothing
further conversions are valid on += and therefore this case is valid.</P>

<P>Note that "<TT>t2++;</TT>" is unquestionably valid, so one could
also argue for the status quo (post-221) on the basis of consistency.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the October 2003 meeting:</B></P>

<P>We believe the example is well-formed, and no change other than
that in issue 221 is needed.</P>
