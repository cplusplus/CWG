<P>In an example like</P>

<PRE>
    template&lt;typename T&gt; void f(T p)-&gt;decltype(p.T::x);
</PRE>

<P>The <I>nested-name-specifier</I> <TT>T::</TT> looks like it refers
to the template parameter.  However, if this is instantiated with a
type like</P>

<PRE>
    struct T { int x; };
    struct S: T { };
</PRE>

<P>the reference will be ambiguous, since it is looked up in both the
context of the expression, finding the template parameter, and in the
class, finding the base class injected-class-name, and this could be
a deduction failure.  As a result, the same declaration with a
different parameter name</P>

<PRE>
    template&lt;typename U&gt; void f(U p)-&gt;decltype(p.U::x);
</PRE>

<P>is, in fact, not a redeclaration because the two can be distinguished
by SFINAE.</P>

<P>It would be better to add a new lookup rule that says that if a
name in a template definition resolves to a template parameter, that
name is not subject to further lookup at instantiation time.</P>

<P><B>Additional note (November, 2020):</B></P>

<P>Paper P1787R6, adopted at the November, 2020 meeting, partially
addresses this issue.</P>

<P><B>CWG 2023-12-01</B></P>

<P>Per the status quo rules, <TT>T::x</TT> is a dependent name and
thus no lookup occurs at template definition time.  At template
instantiation time, <TT>T</TT> is first looked up in the class
of <TT>p</TT> and, if not found, the template parameter <TT>T</TT> is
found.  This, in turn, implies that the two templates discussed above
are not equivalent, because the first potentially references
a <TT>T</TT> member, the other a <TT>U</TT> member of <TT>p</TT>.
</P>

<P>
Subclause 13.7.7.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.over.link">temp.over.link</A>] paragraph 5 is not in conflict
with this interpretation, because no lookup occurs for the <TT>T</TT>
token inside the <TT>decltype</TT> at template definition time at all,
thus (reliably) "name a template parameter" is not satisfied at that
point.
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Two expressions involving template parameters are considered
equivalent if two function definitions containing the expressions
would satisfy the one-definition rule (6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr">basic.def.odr</A>]),
except that the tokens used to name the template parameters may differ
as long as a token used to name a template parameter in one expression
is replaced by another token that names the same template parameter in
the other expression. ...

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In order to clarify this, suggestions for a note including the
example from this issue are welcome.</P>
