Narrowing for literals that cannot be exactly represented

<P>[Voted into WP at October, 2009 meeting.]</P>



<P>Both of the following initializations are ill-formed because of
narrowing, although they were previously well-formed:</P>

<PRE>
    struct A { int i; } a = { 1.0 };
    struct B { float f; } b = { 1.1 };
</PRE>

<P>The first one doesn't seem like a big problem, as there probably
isn't much code that has this kind of aggregate initialization.  The
second might be of more concern, because <TT>1.1</TT> is not
representable in either <TT>float</TT> or <TT>double</TT>.  Is the
resulting loss of precision a kind of narrowing that we want to
diagnose?</P>

<P><B>Notes from the September, 2008 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The CWG agreed that the second initialization should not be a
narrowing error; furthermore, this exemption should apply not
only to literals but to any floating-point constant expression.
Instead of the current formulation, requiring exact bidirectional
convertibility, the Standard should only require that the
initializer value be within the representable range of the target
type.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (July, 2009):</B></P>

<P>Change 9.4.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.list#6">dcl.init.list</A>] paragraph 6 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>A <I>narrowing conversion</I> is an implicit conversion</P>
