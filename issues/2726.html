<P>Subclause 5.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.digraph#2">lex.digraph</A>] paragraph 2 specifies:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

In all respects of the language, each alternative token behaves the
same, respectively, as its primary token, except for its spelling. [
Footnote: ... ]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>However, 9.12.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.attr.grammar#4">dcl.attr.grammar</A>] paragraph 4 specifies:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

... If a keyword (5.12 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.key">lex.key</A>]) or an alternative token
(5.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.digraph">lex.digraph</A>]) that satisfies the syntactic requirements
of an identifier (5.11 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.name">lex.name</A>]) is contained in
an <I>attribute-token</I>, it is considered an identifier. ...

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It seems an alternative token (say, <TT>or</TT>) is treated the
same as the operator <TT>||</TT>, yet only the alternative token is
considered an identifier, not the operator, when appearing in
an <I>attribute-token</I>.  That seems contradictory.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (approved by CWG 2023-05-12):</B></P>

<OL>

<LI>
<P>Change in 5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.phases#2">lex.phases</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Whitespace characters separating tokens are no longer
significant. Each preprocessing token is converted into a token
(5.10 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.token">lex.token</A>])<INS>, replacing each alternative token
by its corresponding primary token (5.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.digraph">lex.digraph</A>])</INS>.
The resulting tokens constitute a translation unit and are
syntactically and semantically analyzed and translated.

<P>Change in 9.12.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.attr.grammar#4">dcl.attr.grammar</A>] paragraph 4 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

... If a keyword (5.12 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.key">lex.key</A>]) <DEL>or an alternative
token (5.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.digraph">lex.digraph</A>])</DEL> that satisfies the syntactic
requirements of an identifier (5.11 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.name">lex.name</A>]) is contained
in an <I>attribute-token</I>, it is considered an identifier. ...

<P><B>Additional notes (May, 2023)</B></P>



<P>During additional discussion on the EWG reflector, Alisdair
Meredith expressed that he intends to propose that some alternative
tokens be treated as full keywords in phase 7, to prevent <TT>and</TT>
from being used as an rvalue reference and <TT>compl</TT> from being
used for naming destructors.  That would reverse the above direction.</P>

<P>
Furthermore, an idea was floated to treat all alternative tokens as
full keywords in phase 7 and as identifiers in phase 4, amending the
grammar productions for expressions as necessary.  This removes the
special treatment of alternative tokens entirely, however the
treatment of examples such as <TT>#define and blah</TT> would change
from ill-formed to well-formed.  Some opposition was voiced against
changing the phase 4 treatment of alternative tokens.
