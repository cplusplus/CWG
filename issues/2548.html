<P>Consider</P>

<PRE>
  int main()
  {
    using IA = int[];
    IA{ 1, 2, 3 } + 0;
  }
</PRE>

<P>This appears to be ill-formed given the current wording, because
the operand is already a prvalue, thus 7.2.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lval#6">basic.lval</A>] paragraph 6 does not apply and the array-to-pointer conversion is not
applied:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Whenever a glvalue appears as an operand of an operator that expects a
prvalue for that operand, the lvalue-to-rvalue
(7.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.lval">conv.lval</A>]), array-to-pointer
(7.3.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.array">conv.array</A>]), or function-to-pointer
(7.3.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.func">conv.func</A>]) standard conversions are applied to
convert the expression to a prvalue.

<P>This outcome might be an oversight in the resolution for
<A HREF="1232.html">issue 1232</A>.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution [SUPERSEDED]:</B></P>

<P>Change in 7.6.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.add#1">expr.add</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The additive operators + and - group left-to-right. The usual
arithmetic conversions (7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.arith.conv">expr.arith.conv</A>]) are performed for
operands of arithmetic or enumeration type. <INS>The array-to-pointer
conversion (7.3.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.array">conv.array</A>]) is applied to an operand of
array type.</INS>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>CWG 2023-07-14</B></P>

<P>CWG is generally in favor of the proposed resolution, but the
interaction with the surrounding text needs to be checked in more
detail after a Working Draft reflecting the Varna straw polls has
become available.</P>

<P><B>Additional notes (September, 2023)</B></P>

<P>It is questionable which use-cases are being addressed by this
change.  On the other hand, <TT>IA{1,2,3}[1]</TT> already works today
(7.2.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lval#6">basic.lval</A>] paragraph 6 and 7.6.1.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.sub#2">expr.sub</A>] paragraph 2).  However, the latter does cause temporary lifetime
extension (6.7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.temporary#6">class.temporary</A>] paragraph 6), whereas the
near-equivalent <TT>*(IA{1,2,3} + 1)</TT> does not.
</P>

<P>Similar to the addition case, indirection through an array prvalue
is also not valid today.  Consistency seems desirable.</P>

<P>Change in 7.6.2.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.unary.op#1">expr.unary.op</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The unary <TT>*</TT> operator performs indirection. <INS>The
array-to-pointer conversion (7.3.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.array">conv.array</A>]) is applied to
an operand of array type; the possibly converted</INS> <DEL>Its</DEL>
operand shall be a prvalue of type &#8220;pointer to T&#8221;, where T
is an object or function type. The operator yields an lvalue of type T
denoting the object or function to which the operand points.

<P>Change in 7.6.2.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.unary.op#7">expr.unary.op</A>] paragraph 7 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The <INS>unary <TT>+</TT> operator performs promotion.  The
array-to-pointer conversion (7.3.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.array">conv.array</A>]) is applied to
an operand of array type; the possibly converted</INS> operand <DEL>of
the unary + operator</DEL> shall be a prvalue of arithmetic, unscoped
enumeration, or pointer type <DEL>and the result is the value of the
argument</DEL>. Integral
promotion <INS>(7.3.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.prom">conv.prom</A>])</INS> is performed on
integral or enumeration operands. <DEL>The type of the result is the
type of the promoted operand.</DEL>
<INS>The operator yields a prvalue of the type of the converted
operand; the result is the value of the converted operand.</INS>

<LI>
<P>Change in 7.6.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.add#1">expr.add</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The additive operators + and - group left-to-right. Each operand shall
be a prvalue. If both operands have arithmetic or unscoped enumeration
type, the usual arithmetic conversions (7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.arith.conv">expr.arith.conv</A>]) are
performed. Otherwise, if one operand has arithmetic or unscoped
enumeration type, integral promotion is applied
(7.3.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.prom">conv.prom</A>]) to that operand.  <INS>The
array-to-pointer conversion (7.3.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.array">conv.array</A>]) is applied to
an operand of array type.</INS> A converted or promoted operand is
used in place of the corresponding original operand for the remainder
of this section.

<LI>
<P>Change in 7.6.1.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.sub#2">expr.sub</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

... The <INS>result of the</INS> expression <TT>E1[E2]</TT> is identical (by definition)
to <INS>that of</INS> <TT>*((E1)+(E2))</TT>, except that in the case of an array operand,
the result is an lvalue if that operand is an lvalue and an xvalue
otherwise.
<div class="ins">
[ Note: The semantics of <TT>E1[E2]</TT> differ from
those of <TT>*((E1)+(E2))</TT> also for
<UL>
<LI>lifetime extension of temporaries (6.7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.temporary">class.temporary</A>]) and</LI>

<P><B>CWG 2023-09-15 (amended 2023-10-09)</B></P>

<P>CWG seeks advice from EWG whether support for array prvalue
operands should be added for the indirection operator, the
unary <TT>+</TT> operator, and the additive operators, along the lines
of the wording above.  Similar to the <TT>[]</TT> operator, the
specification of the indirection operation could be amended to yield
an xvalue if the argument is a prvalue. The unary <TT>+</TT> operator
is occasionally used to force an array-to-pointer decay.</P>

<P>Forwarded to EWG via
<A HREF="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/1633">paper issue 1633</A>.</P>

<P>Paper
<A HREF="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2865r2.pdf">P2865R2</A>
seeks to remove the array-to-pointer conversion for the operands of
relational operators, wheras this issue suggests adding more
applications for the array-to-pointer conversion.  These two
directions appear not to be in harmony.</P>

<P><B>EWG 2023-11-07</B></P>

<P>The lack of support for the corner-case in this issue is not a
defect given the direction in P2865 (Remove Deprecated Array
Comparisons from C++26).</P>
