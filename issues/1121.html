<P>[Voted into the WP at the November, 2010 meeting.]</P>

<A href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3296.html#US33">N3092 comment
  US&#160;33<BR></A>

<P>The resolution of <A HREF="983.html">issue 983</A> restored
an error, inadvertently removed by the resolution of
<A HREF="39.html">issue 39</A>, for the formation of a member
of an ambiguous base class.  For example:</P>

<PRE>
    struct B { int i; };
    struct I1: B { };
    struct I2: B { };
    struct D: I1, I2 { };
    int B::* pm = &amp;D::i;    // Originally and again ambiguous
</PRE>

<P>This error is not necessary, because the result of taking the
address of a member of an ambiguous base class is a pointer to
a member of that class; an actual ambiguity would occur only if
that pointer to a base class member is converted to a pointer to
a member of the derived class.  (See <A HREF="203.html">issue 203</A>,
which suggests changing the result of taking the address of a
member to reflect the naming class of the member instead of the
class of which it is directly a member; if that change were made,
the ambiguity error would be needed.)</P>

<P>The resolution of <A HREF="983.html">issue 983</A> should
be reverted.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (August, 2010):</B></P>

<OL>
<LI><P>Change 7.6.2.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.unary.op#3">expr.unary.op</A>] paragraph 3 as follows:</P></LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

...If the operand is a <I>qualified-id</I> naming a non-static member
<TT>m</TT> of some class <TT>C</TT> with type <TT>T</TT>, the result
has type &#8220;pointer to member of class <TT>C</TT> of type
<TT>T</TT> and is a prvalue designating <TT>C::m</TT><DEL>; the
program is ill formed if C is an ambiguous base (10.2) of the class
designated by the nested-name-specifier of the
qualified-id</DEL>. Otherwise...

<LI><P>Change 6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.member.lookup#13">class.member.lookup</A>] paragraph 13 as follows:</P></LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

[<I>Note:</I> Even if the result of name lookup is unambiguous, use of
a name found in multiple subobjects might still be ambiguous
