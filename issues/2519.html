<P>[Accepted as a DR at the June, 2023 meeting.]</P>

<P>6.7.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.object">intro.object</A>] clearly implies that bit-fields
are objects; paragraphs 8-9 contain phrases like
&#8220;unless an object is a bit-field...&#8221; and
&#8220;a non-bit-field subobject&#8221;. However, the
definition of &#8220;object representation&#8221; in
6.8.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.types.general#4">basic.types.general</A>] paragraph 4 is,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The <I>object representation</I> of an object of
type <TT>T</TT> is the sequence of <I>N</I> <TT>unsigned
char</TT> objects taken up by the object of type <TT>T</TT>,
where <I>N</I> equals <TT>sizeof(T)</TT>.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>and thus fails to address bit-fields, which are not
necessarily composed of a sequence of complete bytes.</P>

<P>The C Standard (6.2.6.1 paragraph 4) says,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Values stored in bit-fields consist of <I>m</I> bits, where
<I>m</I> is the size specified for the bit-field.  The
object representation is the set of <I>m</I> bits the
bit-field comprises in the addressable storage unit holding
it.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Presumably similar wording could be adopted for C++.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (approved by CWG 2023-01-06) [SUPERSEDED]:</B></P>

<P>Change in 6.8.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.types.general#4">basic.types.general</A>] paragraph 4 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The <I>object representation</I> of <DEL>an object
of</DEL> <INS>a</INS> type <TT>T</TT> is the sequence of
<I>N</I> <TT>unsigned char</TT> objects taken up by
<DEL>the</DEL> <INS>a non-bit-field complete</INS> object of type
<TT>T</TT>, where <I>N</I> equals <TT>sizeof(T)</TT>.  The <I>value
representation</I> of <DEL>an object of</DEL> <INS>a</INS>
type <TT>T</TT> is the set of bits <INS>in the object representation
of T</INS> that participate in representing a value of type <TT>T</TT>.
<INS>The object and value representation of a non-bit-field complete
object of type <TT>T</TT> are the bytes and bits, respectively, of the
object corresponding to the object and value representation of its
type. The object representation of a bit-field object is the sequence
of <I>N</I> bits taken up by the object, where <I>N</I> is the width
of the bit-field (11.4.10 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.bit">class.bit</A>]).  The value
representation of a bit-field object is the set of bits in the object
representation that participate in representing its value. </INS> Bits
in the object representation <INS>of a type or object</INS> that are
not part of the value representation are padding bits. For trivially
copyable types, the value representation is a set of bits in the
object representation that determines a value, which is one discrete
element of an implementation-defined set of values. [ Footnote: ... ]

<P><B>CWG 2023-02-06</B></P>

<P>Additional drafting is needed to constrain the definition to
complete object types.</P>

<DEL>the</DEL> <INS>a non-bit-field complete</INS> object of type
