<P>[Voted into the WP at the March, 2011 meeting.]</P>



<P>The ordering imposed by 9.4.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.aggr">dcl.init.aggr</A>] paragraph
17 applies only to &#8220;the full-expressions in an
<I>initializer-clause</I>&#8221; (i.e., what follows an
<TT>=</TT> in an aggregate initializer); this leaves unspecified
the order in which the expressions in an <I>initializer-list</I>
(the term used by the <I>braced-init-list</I> form of
initializer, with no <TT>=</TT>) are evaluated.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the November, 2010 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The CWG favored guaranteeing the order of evaluation of
<I>initializer-clause</I>s appearing in a <I>braced-init-list</I>,
regardless of whether the <I>braced-init-list</I> is an aggregate
initialization or constructor call.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (January, 2011):</B></P>

<OL>
<LI><P>Delete 9.4.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.aggr#17">dcl.init.aggr</A>] paragraph 17:</P></LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<DEL>The full-expressions in an <I>initializer-clause</I> are
evaluated in the order in which they appear.</DEL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI><P>Insert the following as a new paragraph between paragraphs
3 and 4 of 9.4.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.list">dcl.init.list</A>]</P></LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<INS>Within the <I>initializer-list</I> of a <I>braced-init-list</I>,
the <I>initializer-clause</I>s, including any that result from pack
expansions (13.7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.variadic">temp.variadic</A>]), are evaluated in the order
in which they appear. That is, every value computation and side effect
associated with a given <I>initializer-clause</I> is sequenced before
every value computation and side effect associated with any
<I>initializer-clause</I> that follows it in the comma-separated list
of the <I>initializer-list</I>. [<I>Note:</I> This evaluation ordering
holds regardless of the semantics of the initialization; for example,
it applies when the elements of the <I>initializer-list</I> are
interpreted as arguments of a constructor call, even though ordinarily
there are no sequencing constraints on the arguments of a call.
