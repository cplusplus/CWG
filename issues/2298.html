<P>Section 6.9.2.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.races">intro.races</A>] uses the terms &#8220;action&#8221;
and &#8220;expression evaluation&#8221; interchangeably. &#8220;Sequenced
before&#8221; is defined on expression evaluations. Probably none of
those is correct.</P>

<P>We should really be talking about individual accesses to
&#8220;memory locations&#8221;. Talking about larger &#8220;expression
evaluations&#8221; is incorrect, since they may include internal
synchronization. Thus concurrent evaluation of large conflicting
expression evaluations may not actually correspond to a data race.
I'm not sure what term we should be using instead of &#8220;expression
evaluation&#8221; to denote such individual accesses. Call it
<I>X</I> for now.</P>

<P>There is also an issue with the fact that &#8220;sequenced
before&#8221; is defined on expression evaluation. &#8220;Sequenced
before&#8221; should also be defined on <I>X</I>s. It doesn't make
any sense to talk about &#8220;sequenced before&#8221; ordering on
two evaluations when one includes the other. Whenever we say
&#8220;<TT>A</TT> is sequenced before <TT>B</TT>&#8221;, we probably
really mean that all <I>X</I>s in <TT>A</TT> are sequenced before all
<I>X</I>s in <TT>B</TT>. We could probably just include a blanket
statement to that effect.</P>
