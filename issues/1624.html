<P>According to 14.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/except.ctor#2">except.ctor</A>] paragraph 2,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

An object of any storage duration whose initialization or destruction is
terminated by an exception will have destructors executed for all of its
fully constructed subobjects (excluding the variant members of a union-like
class)...

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The restriction for variant members does not appear to be necessary when
there is a <I>mem-initializer</I> or non-static data member initializer for
a union member, as that determines which union member is active during the
execution of the constructor.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (April, 2013):</B></P>

<P>Although the active member in a member union is determined by an
initializer, it could change during the execution of the constructor's
<I>compound=statement</I>.</P>
