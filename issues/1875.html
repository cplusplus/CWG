<P>[Moved to DR at the May, 2015 meeting.]</P>



<P>The rules for class scope in 6.4.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.scope.class">basic.scope.class</A>] paragraph
1 include the following:</P>

<OL START="2">
<LI><P>A name <TT>N</TT> used in a class <TT>S</TT> shall
refer to the same declaration in its context and when re-evaluated in the
completed scope of <TT>S</TT>. No diagnostic is required for a violation of
this rule.</P></LI>

<LI><P>If reordering member declarations in a class yields an alternate valid
program under (1) and (2), the program is ill-formed, no diagnostic is
required.</P></LI>

</OL>

<P>The need for rule #3 is not clear; it would seem that any
otherwise-valid reordering would have to violate rule #2 in order to yield
a different interpretation. Taken literally, rule #3 would also apply to
simply reordering nonstatic data members with no name dependencies at
all.  Can it be simply removed?</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (June, 2014):</B></P>

<P>Delete the third item of 6.4.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.scope.class#1">basic.scope.class</A>] paragraph 1 and
renumber the succeeding items:</P>

<OL START="3"><LI><P><DEL>If reordering member declarations in a
class yields an alternate valid program under (1) and (2), the
program is ill-formed, no diagnostic is
required.</DEL></P></LI></OL>
