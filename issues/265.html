<P>Does the Standard require that the deallocation function will
be called if the destructor throws an exception?  For example,</P>

<PRE>
    struct S {
        ~S() { throw 0; }
    };
    void f() {
        try {
            delete new S;
        }
        catch(...) { }
    }
</PRE>

<P>The question is whether the memory for the S object will be freed
or not.  It doesn't appear that the Standard answers the question,
although most people would probably assume that it will be freed.</P>

<P><B>Notes from 04/01 meeting:</B></P>

<P>There is a widespread feeling that it is a poor programming
practice to allow destructors to terminate with an exception
(see <A HREF="219.html">issue 219</A>).  This question is
thus viewed as a tradeoff between efficiency and supporting "bad
code."  It was observed that there is no way in the current
language to protect against a throwing destructor, since the
throw might come from a virtual override.</P>

<P>It was suggested that the resolution to the issue might be
to make it implementation-defined whether the storage is freed
if the destructor throws.  Others suggested that the Standard
should require that the storage be freed, with the understanding
that implementations might have a flag to allow optimizing away
the overhead.  Still others thought that both this issue and
<A HREF="219.html">issue 219</A> should be resolved by
forbidding a destructor to exit via an exception.  No consensus
was reached.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (October, 2008):</B></P>

<P>It was noticed that <A HREF="353.html">issue 353</A>, an
exact duplicate of this one, was independently opened and
resolved.</P>
