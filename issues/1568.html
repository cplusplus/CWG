Temporary lifetime extension with intervening cast

<P>According to 6.7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.temporary">class.temporary</A>] paragraphs 4-5,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>There are two contexts in which temporaries are destroyed at a
different point than the end of the full-expression...</P>



<P>The second context is when a reference is bound to a temporary.  The
temporary to which the reference is bound or the temporary that is the
complete object of a subobject to which the reference is bound
persists for the lifetime of the reference...
</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It is not clear whether this applies to an example like the
following:</P>

<PRE>
  struct S { };
  const S&amp; r = (const S&amp;)S();
</PRE>

<P>In one sense <TT>r</TT> is being bound to the temporary because
the object to which <TT>r</TT> refers is the temporary object.  From
another perspective, however, <TT>r</TT> is being bound not to a
temporary but to the lvalue expression <TT>(const S&amp;)S()</TT>, or,
more precisely, to the invented temporary variable described in
7.6.1.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.static.cast#4">expr.static.cast</A>] paragraph 4:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Otherwise, an expression <TT>e</TT> can be explicitly converted to a
type <TT>T</TT> using a <TT>static_cast</TT> of the form
<TT>static_cast&lt;T&gt;(e)</TT> if the declaration <TT>T t(e);</TT>
is well-formed, for some invented temporary variable <TT>t</TT>
(9.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init">dcl.init</A>]).  The effect of such an explicit conversion
is the same as performing the declaration and initialization and then
using the temporary variable as the result of the conversion.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>(Since the invented variable <TT>t</TT> is called a
&#8220;temporary,&#8221; perhaps the intent is that its lifetime is
extended to that of <TT>r</TT>, and then the lifetime of the
<TT>S()</TT> temporary would be that of <TT>t</TT>.  However, this
reasoning is tenuous, and it may be better to make the intent
explicitly clear.)</P>

<P>(See also <A HREF="1299.html">issue 1299</A>.)</P>

<P><B>Rationale (April, 2013):</B></P>

<P>This issue is a duplicate of <A HREF="1376.html">issue 1376</A>.</P>
