<P>Moving to always doing overload resolution for determining exception
specifications and implicit deletion creates some unfortunate cycles:</P>

<PRE>
    template&lt;typename T&gt; struct A {
       T t;
    };

    template &lt;typename T&gt; struct B {
       typename T::U u;
    };

    template &lt;typename T&gt; struct C {
       C(const T&amp;);
    };

    template &lt;typename T&gt; struct D {
       C&lt;B&lt;T&gt; &gt; v;
    };

    struct E {
       typedef A&lt;D&lt;E&gt; &gt; U;
    };

    extern A&lt;D&lt;E&gt; &gt; a;
    A&lt;D&lt;E&gt; &gt; a2(a);
</PRE>

<P>If declaring the copy constructor for
<TT>A&lt;D&lt;E&gt;&gt;</TT> is part of instantiating the
class, then we need to do overload resolution on
<TT>D&lt;E&gt;</TT>, and thus <TT>C&lt;B&lt;E&gt;&gt;</TT>.
We consider <TT>C(const B&lt;E&gt;&amp;)</TT>, and therefore
look to see if there's a conversion from
<TT>C&lt;B&lt;E&gt;&gt;</TT> to <TT>B&lt;E&gt;</TT>, which
instantiates <TT>B&lt;E&gt;</TT>, which fails because it has
a field of type <TT>A&lt;D&lt;E&gt;&gt;</TT> which is
already being instantiated.</P>

<P>Even if we wait until <TT>A&lt;D&lt;E&gt;&gt;</TT> is
considered complete before finalizing the copy constructor
declaration, declaring the copy constructor for
<TT>B&lt;E&gt;</TT> will want to look at the copy
constructor for <TT>A&lt;D&lt;E&gt;&gt;</TT>, so we still
have the cycle.</P>

<P>I think that to avoid this cycle we need to short-circuit
consideration of <TT>C(const T&amp;)</TT> somehow.  But I
don't see how we can do that without breaking</P>

<PRE>
    struct F {
       F(F&amp;);
    };

    struct G;
    struct G2 {
       G2(const G&amp;);
    };

    struct G {
       G(G&amp;&amp;);
       G(const G2&amp;);
    };

    struct H: F, G { };

    extern H h;
    H h2(h);
</PRE>

<P>Here, since <TT>G</TT>'s move constructor suppresses the
implicit copy constructor, the defaulted <TT>H</TT> copy
constructor calls <TT>G(const G2&amp;)</TT> instead.  If the
move constructor did not suppress the implicit copy
constructor, I believe the implicit copy constructor would
always be viable, and therefore a better match than a
constructor taking a reference to another type.</P>

<P>So perhaps the answer is to reconsider that suppression
and then disqualify any constructor taking (a reference to)
a type other than the constructor's class from consideration
when looking up a subobject constructor in an implicitly
defined constructor.  (Or assignment operator,
presumably.)</P>

<P>Another possibility would be that when we're looking for
a conversion from <TT>C&lt;B&lt;E&gt;&gt;</TT> to
<TT>B&lt;E&gt;</TT> we could somehow avoid considering, or
even declaring, the <TT>B&lt;E&gt;</TT> copy constructor.
But that seems a bit dodgy.</P>

<P><B>Additional note (October, 2010):</B></P>

<P>An explicitly declared move constructor/op= should not suppress the
implicitly declared copy constructor/op=; it should cause it to be
deleted instead.  This should prevent a member function taking a
(reference to) an un-reference-related type from being chosen by
overload resolution in a defaulted member function.</P>

<P>And we should clarify that member functions taking
un-reference-related types are not even considered during overload
resolution in a defaulted member function, to avoid requiring their
parameter types to be complete.
</P>
