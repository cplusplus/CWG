<P>[Accepted at the November, 2020 meeting as part of paper P1787R6 and
moved to DR at the February, 2021 meeting.]</P>



<P>I have heard a claim that the following code is valid, but I don't
see why.</P>
<PRE>
  struct A {
    int foo ();
  };

  struct B: A {
  private:
    using A::foo;
  };

  int main ()
  {
    return B ().foo ();
  }
</PRE>
<P>
It seems to me that the using declaration in B should hide the
public foo in A. Then the call to B::foo should fail because B::foo
is not accessible in main.</P>

<P>Am I missing something?</P>

<P>
<U>Steve Adamczyk</U>:
This is similar to the last example in 11.8.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.access.base">class.access.base</A>].
In prose, the rule is
that if you have access to cast to a base class and you have access
to the member in the base class, you are given access in the derived
class.  In this case, A is a public base class of B and foo is public
in A, so you can access foo through a B object.  The actual permission
for this is in the fourth bullet in
11.8.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.access.base#4">class.access.base</A>] paragraph 4.</P>

<P>The wording changes for <A HREF="9.html">issue 9</A>
make this clearer, but I believe
even without them this example could be discerned to be valid.</P>

<P>See my paper J16/96-0034, WG21/N0852 on this topic.</P>

<U>Steve Clamage</U>:
But a using-declaration is a declaration (9.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/namespace.udecl">namespace.udecl</A>]).
Compare with</P>
<PRE>
  struct B : A {
  private:
    int foo();
  };
</PRE>
<P>In this case, the call would certainly be invalid, even though your
argument about casting B to an A would make it OK. Your argument
basically says that an access adjustment to make something less
accessible has no effect. That also doesn't sound right.</P>

<P>
<U>Steve Adamczyk</U>:
I agree that is strange.  I do think that's what 11.8.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.access.base">class.access.base</A>]
says, but perhaps that's not what we want it to say.</P>
