<P>The description of name lookup in the
<I>parameter-declaration-clause</I> of member functions in
6.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lookup.unqual">basic.lookup.unqual</A>]
paragraphs 7-8 is
flawed in at least two regards.</P>

<P>First, both paragraphs 7 and 8 apply to the
<I>parameter-declaration-clause</I> of a member function definition
and give different rules for the lookup.  Paragraph 7 applies to names
"used in the definition of a class <TT>X</TT> outside of a member
function body...," which includes the
<I>parameter-declaration-clause</I> of a member function definition,
while paragraph 8 applies to names following the function's
<I>declarator-id</I> (see the proposed resolution of
<A HREF="41.html">issue 41</A>), including the
<I>parameter-declaration-clause</I>.</P>

<P>Second, paragraph 8 appears to apply to the type names used in the
<I>parameter-declaration-clause</I> of a member function defined
inside the class definition.  That is, it appears to allow the
following code, which was not the intent of the Committee:</P>

<PRE>
    struct S {
        void f(I i) { }
        typedef int I;
    };
</PRE>

<P><B>Additional note, January, 2012:</B></P>

<P>
<I>brace-or-equal-initializer</I>s for non-static data members are
intended effectively as syntactic sugar for <I>mem-initializer</I>s in
constructor definitions; the lookup should be the same.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (February, 2021):</B></P>

<P>This issue was resolved by the resolution of
<A HREF="1352.html">issue 1352</A>.</P>
