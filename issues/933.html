<P>[Voted into WP at October, 2009 meeting.]</P>



<P>According to 5.13.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.ccon#2">lex.ccon</A>] paragraph 2,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A character literal that begins with the letter <TT>L</TT>, such as
<TT>L'x'</TT>, is a wide-character literal.  A wide-character literal
has type <TT>wchar_t</TT>. The value of a wide-character literal
containing a single <I>c-char</I> has value equal to the numerical
value of the encoding of the <I>c-char</I> in the execution
wide-character set.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>A <I>c-char</I> that is a universal character name might, when
translated to the execution character set, result in a multi-character
sequence that is larger than can be represented in a <TT>wchar_t</TT>.
There is wording that prevents this in <TT>char16_t</TT> literals, but
not for <TT>wchar_t</TT> literals.  This seems undesirable.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (July, 2009):</B></P>

<OL>
<LI><P>Change 5.13.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.ccon#2">lex.ccon</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P></LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

...The value of a wide-character literal containing a single
<I>c-char</I> has value equal to the numerical value of the encoding
of the <I>c-char</I> in the execution wide-character set<INS>, unless
the <I>c-char</I> has no representation in the execution
wide-character set, in which case the value is
implementation-defined. [<I>Note:</I> The type <TT>wchar_t</TT> is
able to represent all members of the execution wide-character set, see
6.8.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.fundamental">basic.fundamental</A>]. &#8212;<I>end note</I>]</INS>.  The value
of a wide-character literal containing multiple <I>c-char</I>s is
implementation-defined.

<LI><P>Change 5.13.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.ccon#5">lex.ccon</A>] paragraph 5 as follows:</P></LI>

named...
