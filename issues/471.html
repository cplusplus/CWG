Conflicting inherited access specifications

<P>The Standard does not appear to specify how to handle cases in
which conflicting access specifications for a member are
inherited from different base classes.  For example,</P>

<PRE>
    struct A {
    public:
      int i;
    };
    struct B : virtual public A {
    protected:
      using A::i;
    };
    struct C : virtual public A, public B {
      // "i" is protected from B, public from A
    };
</PRE>

<P>This question affects both the existing wording of
11.8.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.access.base#4">class.access.base</A>] paragraph 4 (&#8220;<I>m</I> as a
member of <I>N</I> is public ... <I>m</I> as a member of <I>N</I>
is private ... <I>m</I> as a member of <I>N</I> is
protected&#8221;) and the proposed wording for <A HREF="385.html">issue 385</A> (&#8220;when a nonstatic data member or
nonstatic member function is a protected member of its naming
class&#8221;).</P>

<P>One possible definition of &#8220;is public&#8221; would be
something like, &#8220;if any visible declaration of the entity
has public access.&#8221; One could also plausibly define the
access of <TT>m</TT> in <TT>N</TT> to be the minimum of all the
visible declarations, or even an error if the visible
declarations are inconsistent.</P>

<P>11.8.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.access.base#1">class.access.base</A>] paragraph 1 describes the access of
inherited members, so a clarifying statement resolving this issue
might plausibly be inserted at the end of that paragraph.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (October, 2004):</B></P>

<P>Add the following text as a new paragraph after 11.8.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.access.base#1">class.access.base</A>] paragraph 1:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If a given base class can be reached along more than one path
through a derived class's sub-object lattice (11.7.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mi">class.mi</A>]), a member of that base class could have different
accessibility in the derived class along different paths.  In
such cases, the most permissive access
prevails. [<I>Example:</I>
</P>

<PRE>
    struct B { static int i; };
    class I: protected B { };
    class D1: public B, public I { };
    class D2: public I, private B { };
</PRE>

<P>
<TT>i</TT> is accessible as a public member of <TT>D1</TT> and
as a protected member of <TT>D2</TT>. &#8212;<I>end
example</I>]</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>Rationale (03/2005):</B> This question is already covered, in
almost identical words, in 11.8.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.paths">class.paths</A>].
</P>
