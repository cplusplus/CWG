<P>[Voted into WP at October, 2009 meeting.]</P>

<P>The term &#8220;thread&#8221; is introduced but not defined in
6.9.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.multithread#1">intro.multithread</A>] paragraph 1.  A definition is needed.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (September, 2009):</B></P>

<P>Chamge 6.9.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.multithread#1">intro.multithread</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<INS>A <I>thread of execution</I> (a.k.a. <I>thread</I>) is a single
flow of control within a program, including the initial invocation of
a specific top-level function, and recursively including every
function invocation subsequently executed by the thread. [<I>Note:</I>
When one thread creates another, the initial call to the top-level
function of the new thread is executed by the new thread, not by the
creating thread. &#8212;<I>end note</I>] Every thread in a program can
potentially access every object and function in the program.
[<I>Footnote:</I> An object with automatic or thread storage duration
(6.7.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc">basic.stc</A>]) is associated with one specific thread, and
can be accessed by a different thread only indirectly through a
pointer or reference (6.8.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.compound">basic.compound</A>]).  &#8212;<I>end
footnote</I>]</INS> Under a hosted implementation, a C++ program can
have more than one <DEL><I>thread of execution</I>
(a.k.a. <I>thread</I>)</DEL> <INS>thread</INS> running concurrently...
