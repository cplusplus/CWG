<P>According to 5.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.pptoken#3">lex.pptoken</A>] paragraph 3,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If the input stream has been parsed into preprocessing
tokens up to a given character:</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<P>If the next character begins a sequence of characters that
could be the prefix and initial double quote of a raw string
literal, such as <TT>R"</TT>, the next preprocessing token shall be a
raw string literal. Between the initial and final double
quote characters of the raw string, any transformations
performed in phases 1 and 2 (trigraphs,
universal-character-names, and line splicing) are reverted;
this reversion shall apply before
any <I>d-char</I>, <I>r-char</I>, or delimiting parenthesis
is identified.</P>
</LI>

</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>However, phase 1 is defined as:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Physical source file characters are mapped, in an
implementation-defined manner, to the basic source character
set (introducing new-line characters for end-of-line
indicators) if necessary. The set of physical source file
characters accepted is implementation-defined. Trigraph
sequences (_N4140_.2.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.trigraph">lex.trigraph</A>]) are replaced by
corresponding single-character internal representations. Any
source file character not in the basic source character set
(5.3.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.charset">lex.charset</A>]) is replaced by the
universal-character-name that designates that character.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The reversion described in 5.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.pptoken">lex.pptoken</A>] paragraph
3 specifically does not mention the replacement of physical
end-of-line indicators with new-line characters.  Is it intended
that, for example, a CRLF in the source of a raw string literal
is to be represented as a newline character or as the original
characters?</P>
