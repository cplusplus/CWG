<P>[Accepted at the November, 2020 meeting as part of paper P1787R6 and
moved to DR at the February, 2021 meeting.]</P>



<P>The access rules in 11.8.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.access.base">class.access.base</A>] do not appear to
handle references in nested classes and outside of nonstatic member
functions correctly.  For example,</P>

<PRE>
    struct A {
        typedef int I;    //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> public</SPAN>
    };
    struct B: private A { };
    struct C: B {
        void f() {
            I i1;         //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> error: access violation</SPAN>
        }
        I i2;             //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> OK</SPAN>
        struct D {
            I i3;         //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> OK</SPAN>
            void g() {
                I i4;     //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> OK</SPAN>
            }
        };
    };
</PRE>

<P>The reason for this discrepancy is that the naming class in
the reference to <TT>I</TT> is different in these cases.  According
to 11.8.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.access.base#5">class.access.base</A>] paragraph 5,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The access to a member is affected by the class in which the member is
named. This naming class is the class in which the member name was
looked up and found.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In the case of <TT>i1</TT>, the reference to <TT>I</TT> is subject
to the transformation described in 11.4.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mfct.non.static#3">class.mfct.non.static</A>] paragraph 3:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Similarly during name lookup, when an <I>unqualified-id</I>
(7.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.prim">expr.prim</A>]) used in the definition of a member function
for class <TT>X</TT> resolves to a <TT>static</TT> member, an
enumerator or a nested type of class <TT>X</TT> or of a base class of <TT>X</TT>, the
<I>unqualified-id</I> is transformed into a
<I>qualified-id</I> (7.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.prim">expr.prim</A>]) in which the
<I>nested-name-specifier</I> names the class of the member function.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>As a result, the reference to <TT>I</TT> in the declaration of
<TT>i1</TT> is transformed to <TT>C::I</TT>, so that the naming class
is <TT>C</TT>, and <TT>I</TT> is inacessible in <TT>C</TT>.  In the
remaining cases, however, the transformation does not apply.  Thus,
the naming class of <TT>I</TT> in these references is <TT>A</TT>, and
<TT>I</TT> is publicly accessible in <TT>A</TT>.</P>

<P>Presumably either the definition of &#8220;naming class&#8221;
must be changed or the transformation of <I>unqualified-id</I>s must
be broadened to include all uses within the scope of a class and not
just within nonstatic member functions (and following the
<I>declarator-id</I> in the definition of a static member, per
11.4.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.static#4">class.static</A>] paragraph 4).</P>
