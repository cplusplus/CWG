<P>[Resolved at the October, 2021 meeting by paper P2314R4.]</P>



<P>When a string literal containing an extended character is
stringized (15.6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/cpp.stringize">cpp.stringize</A>]), the result contains a
universal-character-name instead of the original extended character.
The reason is that the extended character is translated to a
universal-character-name in translation phase 1 (5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.phases">lex.phases</A>]), so that the string literal <TT>"@"</TT> (where <TT>@</TT>
represents an extended character) becomes <TT>"\uXXXX"</TT>.  Because
the preprocessing token is a string literal, when the stringizing
occurs in translation phase 4, the <TT>\</TT> is doubled, and the
resulting string literal is <TT>"\"\\uXXXX\""</TT>.  As a result, the
universal-character-name is not recognized as such when the translation
to the execution character set occurs in translation phase 5.  (Note
that phase 5 translation does occur if the stringized extended character
does not appear in a string literal.)  Existing practice appears to
ignore these rules and preserve extended characters in stringized
string literals, however.</P>

<P>See also <A HREF="578.html">issue 578</A>.</P>

<P><B>Additional note (August, 2013):</B></P>

<P>Implementations are granted substantial latitude in their
handling of extended characters and universal-character-names in
5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.phases#1">lex.phases</A>] paragraph 1 phase 1, i.e.,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

(An implementation may use any internal encoding, so long as an actual
extended character encountered in the source file, and the same extended
character expressed in the source file as a universal-character-name (i.e.,
using the <TT>\uXXXX</TT> notation), are handled equivalently except where
this replacement is reverted in a raw string literal.)

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>However, this freedom is mostly nullified by the requirements of
stringizing in 15.6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/cpp.stringize#2">cpp.stringize</A>] paragraph 2:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If, in the replacement list, a parameter is immediately preceded by
a <TT>#</TT> preprocessing token, both are replaced by a single character
string literal preprocessing token that contains the spelling of the
preprocessing token sequence for the corresponding argument.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This means that, in order to handle a construct like</P>

<PRE>
  #define STRINGIZE_LITERAL( X ) # X
  #define STRINGIZE( X ) STRINGIZE_LITERAL( X )

  STRINGIZE( STRINGIZE( identifier_\u00fC\U000000Fc ) )
</PRE>

<P>an implementation must recall the original spelling, including
the form of UCN and the capitalization of any non-numeric hexadecimal
digits, rather than simply translating the characters into a convenient
internal representation.</P>

<P>To effect the freedom asserted in 5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.phases">lex.phases</A>], the
description of stringizing should make the spelling of a
universal-character-name implementation-defined.</P>

<P><B>Additional note (February, 2022):</B></P>

<P>P2314R4 Character sets and encodings (approved in October, 2021)
effected changes so that extended characters are no longer translated
to UCNs in phase 1.</P>
