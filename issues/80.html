<P>Between the May '96 and September '96 working papers, the text in
11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem">class.mem</A>]

paragraph 13:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If <TT>T</TT> is the name of a class, then each of the following
shall have a name different from <TT>T</TT>:
<UL><LI>
every static data member of class <TT>T</TT>;</LI></UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
was changed by removing the word 'static'. Looking over the meeting
minutes from Stockholm, none of the proposals seem to include this
change, which breaks C compatibility and is not mentioned in the compatibility
annex. Was this change actually voted in by the committee?

<P>Specifically, this breaks <TT>/usr/include/netinet/in.h</TT> under Linux,
in which "<TT>struct ip_opts</TT>" shares its name with one of its members.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (10/00):</B></P>
<OL>
<LI>
Change the first bullet of
11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem#13">class.mem</A>] paragraph 13
to say
<UL>
<LI>
every static data member of class <TT>T</TT>;</LI>
</UL>
<LI>
Add another paragraph before
11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem#14">class.mem</A>] paragraph 14,
 reading
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In addition, if class <TT>T</TT> has a user-declared constructor
(11.4.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.ctor">class.ctor</A>]
), every nonstatic
data member of class <TT>T</TT> shall have a name different from
<TT>T</TT>.
