Brace-enclosed initializer for scalar member of aggregate

<P>[Voted into the WP at the June, 2008 meeting as part of paper N2672.]</P>

<P>C (both C90 and C99) appear to allow a declaration of the form</P>

<PRE>
    struct S { int i; } s = { { 5 } };
</PRE>

<P>in which the initializer of a scalar member of an aggregate can
itself be brace-enclosed.  The relevant wording from the C99
Standard is found in 6.7.8 paragraph 11:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The initializer for a scalar shall be a single expression,
optionally enclosed in braces.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>and paragraph 16:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Otherwise, the initializer for an object that has aggregate or
union type shall be a brace-enclosed list of initializers for the
elements or named members.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The &#8220;list of initializers&#8221; in paragraph 16 must be
a recursive reference to paragraph 11 (that's the only place that
describes how an initialized item gets its value from the
initializer expression), which would thus make the
&#8220;brace-enclosed&#8221; part of paragraph 11 apply to each of
the initializers in the list in paragraph 16 as well.</P>

<P>This appears to be an incompatibility between C and C++:
9.4.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.aggr#11">dcl.init.aggr</A>] paragraph 11 says,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If the <I>initializer-list</I> begins with a left brace, then the
succeeding comma-separated list of <I>initializer-clause</I>s
initializes the members of a subaggregate....

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>which clearly leaves the impression that only a subaggregate
may be initialized by a brace-enclosed <I>initializer-clause</I>.</P>

<P>Either the specification in 9.4.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.aggr">dcl.init.aggr</A>]
should be changed to allow a brace-enclosed initializer of a
scalar member of an aggregate, as in C, or this incompatibility
should be listed in Appendix Clause Annex C [<A href="https://wg21.link/diff">diff</A>].</P>

<P><B>Notes from the July, 2007 meeting:</B></P>

<P>It was noted that implementations differ in their handling of this
construct; however, the issue is long-standing and fairly obscure.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the October, 2007 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The initializer-list proposal will resolve this issue when it is
adopted.</P>
