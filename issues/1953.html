<P>[Accepted as a DR at the November, 2024 meeting.]</P>



<P>According to 6.7.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.memory#3">intro.memory</A>] paragraph 3,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A <I>memory location</I> is either an object of scalar type or a
maximal sequence of adjacent bit-fields all having non-zero
width. [<I>Note:</I> Various features of the language, such
as references and virtual functions, might involve
additional memory locations that are not accessible to
programs but are managed by the
implementation. &#8212;<I>end note</I>] Two or more threads
of execution (6.9.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.multithread">intro.multithread</A>]) can update and
access separate memory locations without interfering with
each other.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It is not clear how this relates to the permission
granted in 11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem#18">class.mem</A>] paragraph 18 to inspect
the common initial sequence of standard-layout structs that
are members of a standard-layout union.  If one thread is
writing to the common initial sequence and another is
reading from it via a different struct, that should
constitute a data race, but the current wording does not
clearly state that.</P>

<P><B>Additional notes (October, 2024)</B></P>

<P>(From submission
<A HREF="https://github.com/cplusplus/CWG/issues/621">#621</A>.)
</P>

<P>A similar concern arises for the following example:</P>

<PRE>
  union U { int x, y; } u;
  (u.x = 1, 0) + (u.y = 2, 0);
</PRE>

<P><U>Possible resolution [SUPERSEDED]:</U></P>

<P>Change in 6.7.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.memory#3">intro.memory</A>] paragraph 3 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A <I>memory location</I> is <INS>the storage occupied by the object
representation of</INS> either an object of scalar type that is not a
bit-field or a maximal sequence of adjacent bit-fields all having
nonzero width. ...

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>CWG 2024-10-25</B></P>

<P>Subclause 6.9.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.execution#10">intro.execution</A>] paragraph 10 does not cover
unsequenced object creation that does not change any bits of storage,
such as a placement new invoking a trivial default constructor.  The
original concern in this issue was addressed by P0137R1, adding the
following in 11.4.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mfct#28">class.mfct</A>] paragraph 28:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

In a standard-layout union with an active member
(11.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.union">class.union</A>]) of struct type T1, it is permitted to read
a non-static data member m of another union member of struct type T2
provided m is part of the common initial sequence of T1 and T2; the
behavior is as if the corresponding member of T1 were nominated.
