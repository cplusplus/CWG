<P>There are several problems with 6.7.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc">basic.stc</A>]:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>6.7.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc#2">basic.stc</A>] paragraph 2 says that "Static and automatic
storage durations are associated with objects introduced by
declarations (6.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def">basic.def</A>]) and implicitly created
by the implementation (6.7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.temporary">class.temporary</A>])."</P>

<P>In fact, objects "implicitly created by the implementation" are the
temporaries described in (6.7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.temporary">class.temporary</A>]), and have neither
static nor automatic storage duration, but a totally different duration,
described in 6.7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.temporary">class.temporary</A>].</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>6.7.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc">basic.stc</A>] uses the expression "local object" in several
places, without ever defining it.  Presumably, what is meant is "an
object declared at block scope", but this should be said explicitly.</P>

<P>In a recent discussion in comp.lang.c++.moderated, on poster
interpreted "local objects" as including temporaries.  This would require them
to live until the end of the block in which they are created, which
contradicts 6.7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.temporary">class.temporary</A>]. If temporaries are covered by
this section, and the statement in 6.7.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc">basic.stc</A>]
seems to suggest, and they aren't local objects, then they must have
static storage duration, which isn't right either.</P>

<P>I propose adding a fourth storage duration to the list after
6.7.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc#1">basic.stc</A>] paragraph 1:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
temporary storage duration
</LI>
</UL>
<P>And rewriting the second paragraph of this section as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Temporary storage duration is associated with objects implicitly
created by the implementation, and is described in 6.7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.temporary">class.temporary</A>].
Static and automatic storage durations are associated with objects defined
by declarations; in the following, an object defined by a declaration
with block scope is a local object.  The dynamic storage duration is
associated with objects created by the <TT>operator new</TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<U>Steve Adamczyk</U>:
There may well be an issue here, but one should bear in mind the
difference between storage duration and object lifetime.  As far
as I can see, there is no particular problem with temporaries having
automatic or static storage duration, as appropriate.  The point
of 6.7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.temporary">class.temporary</A>] is that they have an unusual object
lifetime.</P>

<P><B>Notes from Ocrober 2002 meeting:</B></P>

<P>It might be desirable to shorten the storage duration of temporaries
to allow reuse of them.  The as-if rule allows some reuse, but such
reuse requires analysis, including noting whether the addresses of
such temporaries have been taken.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the August, 2011 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The CWG decided that further consideration of this issue would be
deferred until someone produces a paper explaining the need for action
and proposing specific changes.</P>
