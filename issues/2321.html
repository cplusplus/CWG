<P>[Accepted as a DR at the June, 2018 (Rapperswil) meeting.]</P>



<P>The following example is ill-formed:</P>

<PRE>
  struct A {};
  struct B : A {};
  using T = const B;
  A a = true ? A() : T();
</PRE>

<P>We don't convert from <TT>A</TT> to <TT>T</TT> because we can't form an
implicit conversion sequence. We don't convert from <TT>T</TT>
to <TT>A</TT> because <TT>T</TT> is more cv-qualified (even though we could
form an implicit conversion sequence).  It would seem reasonable to accept
this case; it seems that we should only be using cv-qualifiers as a
tie-breaker if the class types are otherwise the same.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (March, 2018):</B></P>

<P>Change 7.6.16 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.cond#4.3">expr.cond</A>] bullet 4.3 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>...Attempts are made to form an implicit conversion sequence from an
operand expression <TT>E1</TT> of type <TT>T1</TT> to a target type related
to the type <TT>T2</TT> of the operand expression <TT>E2</TT> as
follows:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>...</P></LI>

<LI><P>If <TT>E2</TT> is a prvalue or if neither of the conversion
sequences above can be formed and at least one of the operands has
(possibly cv-qualified) class type:</P></LI>

<UL>
<LI><P>if <TT>T1</TT> and <TT>T2</TT> are the same class type (ignoring
cv-qualification)<DEL>, or one is a base class of the other,</DEL>
and <TT>T2</TT> is at least as cv-qualified as <TT>T1</TT> , the target
type is <TT>T2</TT>,</P></LI>

<LI><P><INS>otherwise, if <TT>T2</TT> is a base class of <TT>T1</TT>,
the target type is <I>cv1</I> <TT>T2</TT>, where <I>cv1</I> denotes the
cv-qualifiers of <TT>T1</TT>,</INS></P></LI>

<LI><P>otherwise, the target type is the type that <TT>E2</TT> would have
after applying the lvalue-to-rvalue (7.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.lval">conv.lval</A>]),
array-to-pointer (7.3.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.array">conv.array</A>]), and function-to-pointer
(7.3.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.func">conv.func</A>]) standard conversions.</P></LI>
