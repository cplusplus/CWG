<P>Subclause 6.7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.life#8.5">basic.life</A>] bullet 8.5 says that o1 is
only transparently replaceable by o2 if</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

either o1 and o2 are both complete objects, or o1 and o2 are direct
subobjects of objects p1 and p2, respectively, and p1 is
transparently replaceable by p2.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This disallows most of the intended uses of the transparent
replacement rule, including example 3 in 11.5.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.union.general">class.union.general</A>],
which is similar to:</P>

<PRE>
  union A { int n; string s; };
  A a;
  //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> Does not transparently replace </SPAN>A::s<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> subobject, because</SPAN>
  //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> the created object is a complete object.</SPAN>
  new (&amp;a.s) string("hello");
  string t = a.s;
</PRE>

<P>The rule was changed in response to NB comment US 041 (C++20 CD) in
what appears to be an over-reach: US 041 says that a member subobject
should not transparently replace an unrelated member subobject, but is
silent about complete objects transparently replacing members.</P>

<P><B>CWG 2023-01-06</B></P>

<P>Issues <A HREF="2676.html">2676</A> and
<A HREF="2677.html">2677</A> were split off from this issue.</P>

<P>Subclause 6.7.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.object#2">intro.object</A>] paragraph 2 specifies that "the
created object is a subobject of [the original] containing object" for
the example above.  This issue is therefore NAD.</P>
