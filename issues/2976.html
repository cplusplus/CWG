<P>(From submission
<A HREF="https://github.com/cplusplus/CWG/issues/656">#656</A>.)
</P>

<P>Subclause 8.8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/stmt.dcl#2">stmt.dcl</A>] paragraph 2 specifies:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

... Upon each transfer of control (including sequential execution of
statements) within a function from point P to point Q, all block
variables with automatic storage duration that are active at P and not
at Q are destroyed in the reverse order of their construction. ...;
when a function returns, Q is after its body.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The phrasing "within a function" can be misread as not applying to
transfers out of a function (e.g. execution of a <TT>return</TT>
statement).</P>

<P><U>Possible resolution:</U></P>

<P>Change in 8.8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/stmt.dcl#2">stmt.dcl</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A block variable with automatic storage duration
(6.7.6.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.auto">basic.stc.auto</A>]) is active everywhere in the scope to
which it belongs after its <I>init-declarator</I> . Upon each transfer
of control (including sequential execution of statements)
within <INS>or out of</INS> a function from point P to point Q, all
block variables with automatic storage duration that are active at P
and not at Q are destroyed in the reverse order of their
construction. Then, all block variables with automatic storage
duration that are active at Q but not at P are initialized in
declaration order; unless all such variables have vacuous
initialization (6.7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.life">basic.life</A>]), the transfer of control
shall not be a jump. [ Footnote: ...] When
a <I>declaration-statement</I> is executed, P and Q are the points
immediately before and after it; when a function returns, Q is after
its body.
