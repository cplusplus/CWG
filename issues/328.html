<P>[Voted into WP at March 2004 meeting.]</P>

<P>Is it legal to use an incomplete type (6.8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.types#6">basic.types</A>] paragraph 6)
 as a
class member, if no object of such class is ever created ?</P>

<P>And as a class template member, even if the template is instantiated,
but no object of the instantiated class is created?</P>

<P>The consensus seems to be NO, but no wording was found in the standard
which explicitly disallows it.</P>

<P>The problem seems to be that most of the restrictions on incomplete types
are on their use in objects, but class members are not objects.</P>

<P>A possible resolution, if this is considered a defect, is to add to
6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr#4">basic.def.odr</A>] paragraph 4, (situations when T must be complete),
the use of T as a member of a class or instantiated class template.</P>

<P>The thread on comp.std.c++ which brought up the issue was
"Compiler differences: which is correct?", started 2001 11 30.
&lt;3c07c8fb$0$8507$ed9e5944@reading.news.pipex.net&gt;</P>

<P><B>Proposed Resolution (April 2002, revised April 2003):</B></P>

<P>Change the first bullet of the note in 6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr#4">basic.def.odr</A>] paragraph 4
and add two new bullets following it, as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>an object of type <TT>T</TT> is defined
(6.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def">basic.def</A>]<DEL>, 7.6.2.8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.new">expr.new</A>]</DEL>), or</LI>
<LI>a non-static class data member of type <TT>T</TT> is declared
(11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem">class.mem</A>]), or</LI>
<LI>
<TT>T</TT> is used as the object type or array element type
in a <I>new-expression</I> (7.6.2.8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.new">expr.new</A>]), or</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Replace 11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem#8">class.mem</A>] paragraph 8 by:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Non-<TT>static</TT> (11.4.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.static">class.static</A>]) data members shall
not have incomplete types.
In particular, a class <TT>C</TT> shall not contain a non-<TT>static</TT>
member of class <TT>C</TT>, but it can contain a pointer or reference to
an object of class <TT>C</TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>See also 6.8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.types#6">basic.types</A>] paragraph 6, which is relevant
but not changed by the Proposed Resolution.</P>
