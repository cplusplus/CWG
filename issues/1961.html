<P>[Moved to DR at the November, 2016 meeting.]</P>



<P>According to 6.9.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.multithread#23">intro.multithread</A>] paragraph 23,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Two actions are <I>potentially concurrent</I> if</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>they are performed by different threads, or</P></LI>

<LI><P>they are unsequenced, and at least one is performed by a
signal handler.</P></LI>

</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This definition should exclude the case when both actions
are performed by a signal handler.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the October, 2015 meeting:</B></P>

<P>SG1 agrees that the existing wording should be amended to
say something like &#8220;and they are not both performed by
the same signal handler invocation.&#8221;</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (November, 2015):</B></P>

<P>Change 6.9.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.multithread#23">intro.multithread</A>] paragraph 23 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Two actions are <I>potentially concurrent</I> if</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>they are performed by different threads, or</P></LI>

<LI><P>they are unsequenced, <DEL>and</DEL> at least one is performed by a
signal handler<INS>, and they are not both performed by the
same signal handler invocation</INS>.</P></LI>

</UL>
