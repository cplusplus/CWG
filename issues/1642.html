<P>[Accepted as a DR at the June, 2023 meeting.]</P>

<P>Although the note in 7.2.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lval#1">basic.lval</A>] paragraph 1
states that</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The discussion of each built-in operator in
Clause 7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr">expr</A>] indicates the category of the value
it yields and the value categories of the operands it
expects

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>in fact, many of the operators that take prvalue operands
do not make that requirement explicit.  Possible approaches
to address this failure could be a blanket statement that an
operand whose value category is not stated is assumed to be
a prvalue; adding prvalue requirements to each operand
description for which it is missing; or changing the
description of the usual arithmetic conversions to state
that they imply the lvalue-to-rvalue conversion, which would
cover the majority of the omissions.</P>

<P>(See also <A HREF="1685.html">issue 1685</A>, which deals with
an inaccurately-specified value category.)</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (approved by CWG 2023-04-28):</B></P>

<P>Change in 7.2.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lval#6">basic.lval</A>] paragraph 6 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Whenever a glvalue appears as an operand of an operator
that <DEL>expects</DEL> <INS>requires</INS> a prvalue for that
operand, the lvalue-to-rvalue (7.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.lval">conv.lval</A>]),
array-to-pointer (7.3.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.array">conv.array</A>]), or function-to-pointer
(7.3.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.func">conv.func</A>]) standard conversions are applied to
convert the expression to a prvalue. ...

<P>Change in 7.3.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.general#1">conv.general</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

... A standard conversion sequence will be applied to an expression if
necessary to convert it to <INS>an expression having</INS> a required
destination type <INS>and value category</INS>. ...

<LI>
<P>Add to the bulleted list in 7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.arith.conv#1">expr.arith.conv</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

... This pattern is called the usual arithmetic conversions, which are
defined as follows:
<UL>
<LI class="ins">
The lvalue-to-rvalue conversion (7.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.lval">conv.lval</A>]) is
applied to each operand and the resulting prvalues are used in place
of the original operands for the remainder of this section.</LI>
<LI>If either operand is of scoped enumeration
type (9.7.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.enum">dcl.enum</A>]), no conversions are performed; if
the other operand does not have the same type, the expression is
ill-formed.</LI>

<LI>
<P>Change in 7.6.1.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.call#1">expr.call</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

... For a call to a non-member function or to a static member
function, the postfix expression shall <INS>be</INS>
either <DEL>be</DEL> an lvalue that refers to a function (in which
case the function-to-pointer standard conversion
(7.3.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.func">conv.func</A>]) is suppressed on the postfix expression),

<P>Change in 7.6.2.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.unary.op#7">expr.unary.op</A>] paragraph 7 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The operand of the unary + operator shall <DEL>have</DEL> <INS>be a
prvalue of</INS> arithmetic, unscoped enumeration, or pointer type and
the result is the value of the argument. Integral promotion is
performed on integral or enumeration operands. ...

<P>Change in 7.6.2.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.unary.op#8">expr.unary.op</A>] paragraph 8 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The operand of the unary - operator shall <DEL>have</DEL> <INS>be a
prvalue of</INS> arithmetic or unscoped enumeration type and the
result is the negative of its operand. Integral promotion is performed
on integral or enumeration operands. ...

<P>Change in 7.6.2.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.delete#1">expr.delete</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

... <DEL>The operand shall be of pointer to object type or of class
type.</DEL> If <INS>the operand is</INS> of class type, <DEL>the
operand</DEL> <INS>it</INS> is contextually implicitly converted
(7.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv">conv</A>]) to a pointer to object type. [ Footnote:

type.</INS> The <I>delete-expression</I> has type void.

have arithmetic or unscoped enumeration type, the</INS> usual
arithmetic conversions (7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.arith.conv">expr.arith.conv</A>]) are performed
<DEL>for operands of arithmetic or enumeration type</DEL>.
<INS>Otherwise, if one operand has arithmetic or unscoped enumeration
type, integral promotion is applied (7.3.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.prom">conv.prom</A>]) to
that operand.  A converted or promoted operand is used in place of the
corresponding original operand for the remainder of this
section.</INS> ...
For addition, either both operands shall
have arithmetic <DEL>or unscoped enumeration</DEL> type, or one operand shall be
a pointer to a completely-defined object type and the other shall have
integral <DEL>or unscoped enumeration</DEL> type.
