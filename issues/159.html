Namespace qualification in declarators

<P>9.3.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.meaning#1">dcl.meaning</A>] paragraph 1
says:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the qualified <I>declarator-id</I> for a class or namespace member
definition that appears outside of the member's class or namespace,
the <I>nested-name-specifier</I> shall not name any of the namespaces that
enclose the member's definition.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This results in the following behavior:

<PRE>
    namespace N {
        namespace M {
            void f();
            void g();
        }
        void M::f(){}     // okay
        void N::M::g(){}  // error
    }
</PRE>

I was very surprised when this rule was pointed out to me.  The change
appears to have been introduced around the time of the first Santa
Cruz meeting, but I don't recall discussion of it and could not find a
motion related to it.

<P>Regardless of where it came from, I also can't understand why it is there.
Certainly it shouldn't matter <I>how</I> you name a given class or namespace.</P>

<P>For example, the standard permits:</P>

<PRE>
    namespace N {
        namespace M {
            void f();
            void g();
        }
        namespace X = M;
        namespace Y = N::M;
        void X::f(){}  // okay
        void Y::g(){}  // okay
    }
</PRE>

So, it is okay to use an alias for <TT>N::M</TT>,
but not to use <TT>N::M</TT> directly.
Note that it <I>is</I> okay to use <TT>N::M</TT>
in any other context at this point
in the program (i.e., the rule is a specific restriction on declarator
names, not a general rule on the use of qualified names).

<P>Does anyone recall the intent of this rule or any rationale for its
existence?</P>

<P><B>Notes from 04/00 meeting:</B></P>

<P>There was some question as to whether this issue actually
constituted a defect in the Standard.  John Spicer suggested that
machine-generated source code would be likely to run afoul of this
prohibition.  Francis Glassborow expressed support for a rule that
would allow full qualification, or qualification relative to the
namespace containing the definition, but not qualification relative to
a containing namespace.  There was no consensus for moving forward
with a DR at this point, so the issue was left in "review" status.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (10/00):</B></P>

<P>Remove the last sentence of
9.3.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.meaning#1">dcl.meaning</A>] paragraph 1 (cited above) and the example
that follows.</P>
