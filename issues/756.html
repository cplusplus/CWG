<P>[Voted into the WP at the July, 2009 meeting as part of N2927.]</P>



<P>Consider the following example:</P>

<PRE>
    void f() {
      int const N = 10;
      [=]() mutable { N = 30; }  // Okay: this-&gt;N has type int, not int const.
      N = 20;  // Error.
    }
</PRE>

<P>That is, the <TT>N</TT> that is a member of the closure object is not
const, even though the captured variable is const.  This seems strange,
as capturing is basically a means of capturing the local environment in a
way that avoids lifetime issues.  More seriously, the change of type
means that the results of <TT>decltype</TT>, overload resolution, and
template argument deduction applied to a captured variable inside a
lambda expression can be different from those in the scope containing
the lambda expression, which could be a subtle source of bugs.</P>

<P>On the other hand, the copying involved in capturing has uses beyond
avoiding lifetime issues (taking snapshots of values, avoiding data
races, etc.), and the value of a cv-qualified object is not cv-qualified.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (July, 2009)</B></P>
