Unions and aliasing

<P>The C++ standard says in 7.2.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lval">basic.lval</A>], in paragraph 15:</P>

<UL><LI><P>an aggregate or union type that includes one of the
aforementioned types among its members (including, recursively, a
member of a subaggregate or contained union),</P></LI></UL>

<P>Note that it is a literal copy from the C standard, but this is of
course not the problem.</P>

<P>In C, union is not defined as an aggregate type. Therefore it is
appropriate to say &#8220;aggregate or union.&#8221; But things
changed in C++: aggregate type includes union type now (though not all
unions are aggregates), and it becomes clear that the
&#8220;union&#8221; in &#8220;aggregate or union&#8221; is redundant
and should be deleted.</P>

<P>The above cited paragraph could be changed to:</P>

<UL><LI><P>an aggregate type that includes one of the aforementioned
types among its members (including, recursively, a member of a
subaggregate)</P></LI></UL>

<P><B>Rationale (October, 2006):</B></P>

<P>As noted in the issue, not all unions are aggregates, but those
that are not aggregates still allow aliasing.  That part of the
specification would be lost with the suggested change.</P>
