<P>[Accepted as a DR at the November, 2022 meeting.]</P>

<P>Subclause 9.3.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.ambig.res#1">dcl.ambig.res</A>] paragraph 1 specifies:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The ambiguity arising from the similarity between a function-style
cast and a declaration mentioned in 8.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/stmt.ambig">stmt.ambig</A>] can also
occur in the context of a declaration. In that context, the choice is
between a function declaration with a redundant set of parentheses
around a parameter name and an object declaration with a
function-style cast as the initializer. Just as for the ambiguities
mentioned in 8.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/stmt.ambig">stmt.ambig</A>], the resolution is to consider
any construct that could possibly be a declaration a declaration.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The specification correctly describes an ambiguity between a
function declaration and an object declaration, but resolves the
ambiguity to a "declaration", which does not offer any insight.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (2022-09-09) [SUPERSEDED]:</B></P>

<P>Change in 9.3.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.ambig.res#1">dcl.ambig.res</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>
