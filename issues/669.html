Confusing specification of the meaning of <TT>decltype</TT>

<P>The first bullet of 9.2.9.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.type.simple#4">dcl.type.simple</A>] paragraph 4 says,</P>

<UL><LI>if <TT>e</TT> is an <I>id-expression</I> or a class member
access (7.6.1.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.ref">expr.ref</A>]), <TT>decltype(e)</TT> is the type
of the entity named by <TT>e</TT>.</LI></UL>

<P>There are two clarifications to this specification that would
assist the reader.  First, it would be useful to have a note
highlighting the point that a parenthesized expression is neither
an <I>id-expression</I> nor a member access expression.</P>

<P>Second, the phrase &#8220;the type of the entity named
by <TT>e</TT>&#8221; is unclear as to whether cv-qualification in the
object or pointer expression is or is not part of that type.
Rephrasing this to read, &#8220;the <INS>declared</INS> type of the
entity,&#8221; or adding &#8220;(ignoring any cv-qualification in the
object expression or pointer expression),&#8221; would clarify the
intent.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (February, 2008):</B></P>

<P>The text is clear enough.  In particular, both of these points are
illustrated in the last two lines of the example contrasting
<TT>decltype(a-&gt;x)</TT> and <TT>decltype((a-&gt;x))</TT>: in the
former, the expression has no parentheses, thus satisfying the
requirements of the first bullet and yielding the declared type of
<TT>A::x</TT>, while the second has parentheses, falling into the
third bullet and picking up the <TT>const</TT> from the object
expression in the member access.</P>
