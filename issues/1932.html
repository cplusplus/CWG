<P>[Adopted at the February, 2016 meeting.]</P>



<P>According to 7.6.16 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.cond#3">expr.cond</A>] paragraph 3,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>if the second and third operand have different types and either has
(possibly cv-qualified) class type, or if both are glvalues of the same
value category and the same type except for cv-qualification, an attempt is
made to convert each of those operands to the type of the other. The
process for determining whether an operand expression <TT>E1</TT> of
type <TT>T1</TT> can be converted to match an operand
expression <TT>E2</TT> of type <TT>T2</TT> is defined as follows:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>If E2 is an lvalue: <TT>E1</TT> can be converted to
match <TT>E2</TT> if <TT>E1</TT> can be implicitly converted (
7.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv">conv</A>]) to the type &#8220;lvalue reference
to <TT>T2</TT>&#8221;, subject to the constraint that in the conversion the
reference must bind directly (9.4.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.ref">dcl.init.ref</A>]) to an
lvalue.</P></LI>

</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If two bit-field glvalues have exactly the same scalar type, paragraph
3 does not apply (two non-class operands must differ in at least
cv-qualification).  For an example like</P>

<PRE>
  struct S {
    int i:3;
    const int j:4;
  } s;
  int k = true ? s.i : s.j;
</PRE>

<P>the condition is satisfied.  The intent is that <TT>S::i</TT> can be
converted to <TT>const int</TT> but <TT>S::j</TT> cannot be converted
to <TT>int</TT>, so the result should be a bit-field lvalue of
type <TT>const int</TT>.  However, the test for convertibility is phrased
in terms of direct reference binding, which is inapplicable to bit-fields,
resulting in neither conversion succeeding, leading to categorizing the
expression as ambiguous.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (October, 2015):</B></P>

<P>This issue is resolved by the resolution of
<A HREF="1895.html">issue 1895</A>.</P>
