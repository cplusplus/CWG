<P>The subject line pretty much says it all.  It's a possibility that
hadn't ever occurred to me.  I don't see any prohibition in the
standard, and I also don't think the possibility introduces any logical
inconsistencies.  The proper behavior, presumably, would be to go
through the list of already-constructed objects (not including the
current one, since its constructor wouldn't have finished executing)
and destroy them in reverse order.  Not fundamentally hard, and I'm
sure lots of existing implementations already do that.</P>

<P>I'm just not sure whether the standard was intended to support this, or
whether it's just that nobody else thought of it either.  If the
former, then a non-normative note somewhere in
6.9.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.start.static">basic.start.static</A>] might be nice.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (October 2004):</B></P>

<P>There is nothing in the Standard to indicate that this usage
is prohibited, so it must be presumed to be permitted.</P>
