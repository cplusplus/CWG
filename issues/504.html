Should use of a variable in its own initializer require a diagnostic?

<P> Split
off from <A HREF="453.html">issue 453</A>.</P>

<P>It is in general not possible to determine at compile time whether
a reference is used before it is initialized.  Nevertheless, there is
some sentiment to require a diagnostic in the obvious cases that can
be detected at compile time, such as the name of a reference appearing
in its own initializer.  The resolution of <A HREF="453.html">issue 453</A> originally made such uses ill-formed, but the CWG decided
that this question should be a separate issue.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (October, 2005):</B></P>

<P>The CWG felt that this error was not likely to arise very
often in practice.  Implementations can warn about such constructs,
and the resolution for <A HREF="453.html">issue 453</A> makes
executing such code undefined behavior; that seemed to address the
situation adequately.</P>

<P><B>Note (February, 2006):</B></P>

<P>Recent discussions  have suggested that undefined behavior be
reduced.  One possibility (broadening the scope of this issue to
include object declarations as well as references) was to require a
diagnostic if the initializer uses the value, but not just the
address, of the object or reference being declared:</P>

<PRE>
    int i = i;        //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> Ill-formed, diagnostic required</SPAN>
    void* p = &amp;p;     //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> Okay</SPAN>
</PRE>

<P><B>Rationale (2023-05-12)</B></P>

<P>This is an extension whose detailed specification requires a paper
targeted at EWG.  Some implementations warn about the situation in
question.</P>
