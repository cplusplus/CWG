<P>[Moved to DR at the November, 2014 meeting.]</P>



<P>The intent of <TT>char16_t</TT> string literals, as
evident from 5.13.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.string#9">lex.string</A>] paragraph 9, is
that they be encoded in UTF-16, that is, including surrogate
pairs to represent code points outside the basic
multi-lingual plane:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A single <I>c-char</I> may produce more than
one <TT>char16_t</TT> character in the form of surrogate
pairs.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Paragraph 15, however, is inconsistent with this approach,
saying,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Escape sequences and universal-character-names in non-raw
string literals have the same meaning as in character
literals (5.13.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.ccon">lex.ccon</A>]), except that the
single quote <TT>'</TT> is representable either by itself or
by the escape sequence <TT>\'</TT>, and the double
quote <TT>"</TT> shall be preceded by a <TT>\</TT>.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The reason is that code points outside the basic
multi-lingual plane are ill-formed in <TT>char16_t</TT>
character literals:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A character literal that begins with the letter <TT>u</TT>, such as
<TT>u'y'</TT>, is a character literal of
type <TT>char16_t</TT>. The value of a <TT>char16_t</TT>
literal containing a single <I>c-char</I> is equal to its
ISO 10646 code point value, provided that the code point is
representable with a single 16-bit code unit. (That is,
provided it is a basic multi-lingual plane code point.) If
the value is not representable within 16 bits, the program
is ill-formed.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It should be clarified that this restriction does not apply
to <TT>char16_t</TT> string literals.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (February, 2014):</B></P>

<P>Change 5.13.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.string#16">lex.string</A>] paragraph 16 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Escape sequences and universal-character-names in non-raw string literals
have the same meaning as in character literals
(5.13.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.ccon">lex.ccon</A>]), except that the single quote <TT>'</TT> is
representable either by itself or by the escape sequence <TT>\'</TT>, and
the double quote <TT>"</TT> shall be preceded by a <TT>\</TT><INS>, and
except that a universal-character-name in a <TT>char16_t</TT> string
literal may yield a surrogate pair</INS>. In a narrow string literal...
