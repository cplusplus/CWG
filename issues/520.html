<P>[Voted into WP at April, 2007 meeting.]</P>

<P>7.6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.cast#6">expr.cast</A>] paragraph 6 says,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The operand of a cast using the cast notation can be an rvalue of type
&#8220;pointer to incomplete class type&#8221;. The destination type
of a cast using the cast notation can be &#8220;pointer to incomplete
class type&#8221;. In such cases, even if there is a inheritance
relationship between the source and destination classes, whether the
<TT>static_cast</TT> or <TT>reinterpret_cast</TT> interpretation is
used is unspecified.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The wording seems to allow the following:</P>

<OL>

<LI><P>casting from void pointer to incomplete type</P></LI>

<PRE>
    struct A;
    struct B;

    void *v;
    A *a = (A*)v; // allowed to choose reinterpret_cast
</PRE>

<LI><P>variant application of static or reinterpret casting</P></LI>

<PRE>
    B *b = (B*)a;    // compiler can choose static_cast here
    A *aa = (A*)b;   // compiler can choose reinterpret_cast here
    assert(aa == a); // might not hold
</PRE>

<LI><P>ability to somehow choose static_cast</P></LI>

<P>It's not entirely clear how a compiler can
choose <TT>static_cast</TT> as 7.6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.cast#6">expr.cast</A>] paragraph 6
seems to allow. I believe the intent of 7.6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.cast#6">expr.cast</A>] paragraph 6
is to force the use of <TT>reinterpret_cast</TT> when
either are incomplete class types and <TT>static_cast</TT> iff the
compiler knows both types and there is a non-ambiguous
hierarchy-traversal between that cast (or maybe not, <A HREF="242.html">core issue 242</A> talks about this). I cannot see any
other interpretation because it isn't intuitive, every compiler I've
tried agrees with me, and neither standard pointer conversions
(7.3.12 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.ptr#3">conv.ptr</A>] paragraph 3) nor <TT>static_cast</TT>
(7.6.1.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.static.cast#5">expr.static.cast</A>] paragraph 5) talk about incomplete
class types. If the committee agrees with me, I would like to see
7.3.12 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.ptr#3">conv.ptr</A>] paragraph 3 and 7.6.1.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.static.cast#5">expr.static.cast</A>] paragraph 5 explicitly disallow incomplete class
types and the wording of 7.6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.cast#6">expr.cast</A>] paragraph 6
changed to not allow any other interpretation.</P>

</OL>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (April, 2006):</B></P>

<P>Change 7.6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.cast#6">expr.cast</A>] paragraph 6 as indicated:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The operand of a cast using the cast notation can be an rvalue of type
&#8220;pointer to incomplete class type.&#8221; The destination type
of a cast using the cast notation can be &#8220;pointer to incomplete
class type.&#8221; <DEL>In such cases, even if there is a inheritance
relationship between the source and destination classes, whether
the <TT>static_cast</TT> or <TT>reinterpret_cast</TT> interpretation
is used is unspecified.</DEL> <INS>If both the operand and destination types
are class types and one or both are incomplete, it is unspecified
whether the <TT>static_cast</TT> or the <TT>reinterpret_cast</TT>
interpretation is used, even if there is an inheritance relationship
between the two classes. [<I>Note:</I> For example, if the classes
were defined later in the translation unit, a multi-pass compiler
would be permitted to interpret a cast between pointers to the classes
as if the class types were complete at that point.  &#8212;<I>end
note</I>]</INS>
