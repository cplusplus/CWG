<P>The implicit declaration of a special member function sometimes
requires overload resolution, in order to select a special member to
use for base classes and non-static data members. This can be required
to determine whether the member is or would be deleted, and whether
the member is trivial, for instance. The standard appears to require
such overload resolution be performed at the end of the definition of
the class, but in practice, implementations perform it lazily. This
optimization appears to be non-conforming, in the case where overload
resolution would hit an error.  In order to enable this optimization,
such errors should be &#8220;no diagnostic required.&#8221;</P>

<P><B>Notes from the September, 2013 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The problem with this approach is that hard errors (not in the
immediate context) can occur, affecting portability.  There are some
cases, such as a virtual assignment operator in the base class, where
lazy evaluation cannot be done, so it cannot be mandated.</P>
