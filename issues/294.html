<P>[Picked up by evolution group at October 2002 meeting.]</P>

<P>Is it okay for a <TT>static_cast</TT> to drop exception
specifications?</P>
<PRE>
    void f() throw(int);
    int main () {
      static_cast&lt;void (*)() throw()&gt;(f);  // Okay?
      void (*p)() throw() = f;  // Error
    }
</PRE>

<P>The fact that a <TT>static_cast</TT> is defined, more or less,
as an initialization suggests that a check ought to be made.</P>

<P>One tricky point: this is another case where the general rule that
the reverse of an implicit cast is allowed as a <TT>static_cast</TT>
bites you -- the reverse conversion doesn't drop exception
specifications, and so is okay.  Perhaps this should be treated
like casting away constness.</P>

:
I don't think that case can arise.  According to 14.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/except.spec">except.spec</A>],
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
An exception-specification shall appear only on a function
declarator in a function, pointer, reference, or pointer to
member declaration or definition.

<P>We strengthened that in <A HREF="87.html">issue 87</A>
(voted to DR status in Copenhagen) to</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
An exception-specification shall appear only on a function
declarator for a function type, pointer to function type,
reference to function type, or pointer to member function
type that is the top-level type of a declaration or
definition, or on such a type appearing as a parameter or
return type in a function declarator.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As I read that, you can't put an exception-specification on the
type-id in a static_cast, which means that a static_cast can
only weaken, not strengthen, the exception specification.</P>

<P>The core WG discussed this at the 10/01 meeting and agreed.</P>

<P><B>Note (March, 2008):</B></P>

<P>The Evolution Working Group recommended closing this issue with no
further consideration.  See paper J16/07-0033 = WG21 N2173.</P>
