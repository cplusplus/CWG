<P>[Voted into WP at March, 2010 meeting.]</P>



<P>Consider the following example:</P>

<PRE>
    struct C { };

    struct A {
       explicit operator int() const;
       explicit operator C() const;
    };

    struct B {
       int i;
       B(const A&amp; a): i(a) { }
    };

    int main() {
       A a;
       int i = a;
       int j(a);
       C c = a;
       C c2(a);
    }
</PRE>

<P>It's clear that the <TT>B</TT> constructor and the declaration of
<TT>j</TT> are well-formed and the declarations of <TT>i</TT> and
<TT>c</TT> are ill-formed.  But what about the declaration of <TT>c2</TT>?
This is supposed to work, but it doesn't under the current wording.
</P>

<P>
<TT>C c2(a)</TT> is direct-initialization of a class, so
constructors are considered.  The only possible candidate is the
default copy constructor.  So we look for a conversion from <TT>A</TT>
to <TT>const C&amp;</TT>.  There is a conversion operator to
<TT>C</TT>, but it is explicit and we are now performing
copy-initialization of a reference temporary, so it is not a
candidate, and the declaration of <TT>c2</TT> is ill-formed.
</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (October, 2009):</B></P>

<P>Change 12.2.2.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.match.copy#1">over.match.copy</A>] paragraph 1 second bullet
as follows:</P>

<UL><LI>When the type of the initializer expression is a class type
&#8220;<I>cv</I> <TT>S</TT>&#8221;, the non-explicit conversion
functions of <TT>S</TT> and its base classes are considered. <INS>When
initializing a temporary to be bound to the first parameter of a copy
constructor (11.4.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.ctor">class.copy.ctor</A>]) called with a single argument
in the context of direct-initialization, explicit conversion functions
are also considered.</INS> Those that are not hidden within <TT>S</TT>
and yield a type whose cv-unqualified version is the same type as
<TT>T</TT> or is a derived class thereof are candidate functions.
Conversion functions that return &#8220;reference to <TT>X</TT>&#8221;
return lvalues or rvalues, depending on the type of reference, of type
<TT>X</TT> and are therefore considered to yield <TT>X</TT> for this
process of selecting candidate functions.</LI></UL>
