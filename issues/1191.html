Deleted subobject destructors and implicitly-defined constructors

<P>[Voted into the WP at the March, 2011 meeting.]</P>



<P>Consider the following example:</P>

<PRE>
    struct A {
       A();
       ~A() = delete;
    };

    struct B: A { };
    B* b = new B;
</PRE>

<P>Under the current rules, <TT>B()</TT> is not deleted, but is
ill-formed because it calls the deleted <TT>~A::A()</TT> if it exits
via an exception after the completion of the construction of
<TT>A</TT>. A deleted subobject destructor should be added to the list
of reasons for implicit deletion in 11.4.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.ctor">class.ctor</A>] and
11.4.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.ctor">class.copy.ctor</A>].</P>

<P><B>Notes from the November, 2010 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The CWG agreed that a change was needed, but only if one or more
base and/or member constructors are non-trivial.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (January, 2011):</B></P>

<OL>
<LI><P>Add a new bullet to 11.4.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.ctor#5">class.ctor</A>] paragraph 5 as
follows:</P></LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>...A defaulted default constructor for class <TT>X</TT> is defined
as deleted if:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>...</P></LI>

<LI><P>
<TT>X</TT> is a non-union class and all members of any
anonymous union member are of const-qualified type (or array thereof),
<DEL>or</DEL>
</P></LI>

<LI><P>any direct or virtual base class, or non-static data member
with no <I>brace-or-equal-initializer</I>, has class type <TT>M</TT>
(or array thereof) and either <TT>M</TT> has no default constructor or
overload resolution (12.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.match">over.match</A>]) as applied to
<TT>M</TT>'s default constructor results in an ambiguity or in a
function that is deleted or inaccessible from the defaulted default
constructor<DEL>.</DEL><INS>, or</INS>
</P></LI>

<LI><P><INS>any direct or virtual base class or non-static data member
has a type with a destructor that is deleted or inaccessible from the
defaulted default constructor.</INS></P></LI>

</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI><P>Add a new bullet to 11.4.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.ctor#12">class.copy.ctor</A>] paragraph 12 as
follows:</P></LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>...A defaulted copy/move constructor for a class <TT>X</TT> is
defined as deleted (9.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct.def.delete">dcl.fct.def.delete</A>]) if X has:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>a variant member with a non-trivial corresponding
constructor and <TT>X</TT> is a union-like class,</P></LI>

<LI><P>a non-static data member of class type <TT>M</TT> (or array
thereof) that cannot be copied/moved because overload resolution
(12.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.match">over.match</A>]), as applied to <TT>M</TT>'s corresponding
constructor, results in an ambiguity or a function that is deleted or
inaccessible from the defaulted constructor, <DEL>or</DEL>
</P></LI>

<LI><P>a direct or virtual base class <TT>B</TT> that cannot be
copied/moved because overload resolution (12.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.match">over.match</A>]),
as applied to <TT>B</TT>'s corresponding constructor, results in an
ambiguity or a function that is deleted or inaccessible from the
defaulted constructor, <DEL>or</DEL>
</P></LI>

<LI><P><INS>any direct or virtual base class or non-static data member
of a type with a destructor that is deleted or inaccessible from the
defaulted constructor,</INS></P></LI>

<LI><P>for the copy constructor, a non-static data member of rvalue
reference type, or</P></LI>

<LI><P>for the move constructor, a non-static data member or direct or
virtual base class with a type that does not have a move constructor
and is not trivially copyable.</P></LI>
