<P>(From editorial issue
<A HREF="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/4893">4893</A>.)</P>

<P>It is unclear whether the representation of unsigned integral types
is unspecified or implementation-defined.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution [SUPERSEDED]:</B></P>

<P>Change in 6.8.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.fundamental#17">basic.fundamental</A>] paragraph 17 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The types described in this subclause are called <I>fundamental types</I>.
<INS>The representation of a fundamental type is unspecified except as
stated in this subclause.</INS>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>CWG 2023-12-01</B></P>

<P>Since there is no requirement for "implementation-defined" in the
specification, the representation is unspecified by omission.  It was
noted that "unspecified behavior" has well-defined (and narrow)
meaning, whereas the not-specified property here is static throughout
the instance of the abstract machine.  In that sense, it is similar to
implementation-defined, abent the documentation requirement.  It might
be worthwhile to have a defined term for such properties.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution:</B></P>

<P>Change in 6.8.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.fundamental#17">basic.fundamental</A>] paragraph 17 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The types described in this subclause are called <I>fundamental types</I>.
<INS>The representation of a fundamental type is implementation-defined, subject to the constraints in this subclause.</INS>
