<P>[Accepted as a DR at the June, 2023 meeting.]</P>

<P>Subclause 5.13.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.icon#4">lex.icon</A>] paragraph 4 specifies:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If an <I>integer-literal</I> cannot be represented by any type in its
list and an extended integer type (6.8.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.fundamental">basic.fundamental</A>]) can
represent its value, it may have that extended integer type. If all of
the types in the list for the <I>integer-literal</I> are signed, the
extended integer type shall be signed. If all of the types in the list
for the <I>integer-literal</I> are unsigned, the extended integer type
shall be unsigned. If the list contains both signed and unsigned
types, the extended integer type may be signed or unsigned. A program
is ill-formed if one of its translation units contains
an <I>integer-literal</I> that cannot be represented by any of the
allowed types.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This implies that an <I>integer-literal</I> with a <TT>z</TT>
suffix can be of extended integer type, if the literal is larger than
what is representable in <TT>std::size_t</TT>.</P>

<P>According to the author of the paper
<A HREF="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p0330r8.html">P0330R8</A>
(Literal Suffix for (signed) size_t) introducing the feature, this is
unintentional; <TT>z</TT> should only yield <TT>std::size_t</TT> and
its corresponding signed integer type.</P>

<P>See also the corresponding WG14 paper
<A HREF="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2998.htm">N2998
Literal Suffixes for size_t</A>.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (reviewed by CWG 2023-03-03, approved by CWG 2023-05-12):</B></P>

<P>Change in 5.13.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.icon#4">lex.icon</A>] paragraph 4 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<DEL>If</DEL> <INS>Except for <I>integer-literal</I>s containing
a <I>size-suffix</I>, if the value of</INS> an <I>integer-literal</I>
cannot be represented by any type in its list and an extended integer
type (6.8.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.fundamental">basic.fundamental</A>]) can represent its value, it may have
that extended integer type. If all of the types in the list for
the <I>integer-literal</I> are signed, the extended integer type
<DEL>shall be </DEL> <INS>is</INS> signed. If all of the types in the
list for the <I>integer-literal</I> are unsigned, the extended integer
type <DEL>shall be</DEL> <INS>is</INS> unsigned. If the list contains
both signed and unsigned types, the extended integer type may be
signed or unsigned. <DEL>A program is ill-formed if one of its
translation units contains</DEL> <INS>If</INS> an
<I>integer-literal</I> <DEL>that</DEL> cannot be represented by any
of the allowed types<INS>, the program is ill-formed</INS>.
<INS>[ Note: An <I>integer-literal</I> with a <TT>z</TT> or <TT>Z</TT>
suffix is ill-formed if it cannot be represented by
<TT>std::size_t</TT>.  -- end note ]</INS>

<P><B>Additional notes (February, 2023)</B></P>

<P>Alerted the chair of SG22 (C/C++ Liaison).</P>

<P>Forwarded to EWG at the request of the EWG chair via
<A HREF="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/1467">cplusplus/papers#1467</A>.</P>

<P><B>EWG 2023-05-11</B></P>

<P>The "z" suffixes mean <TT>std::size_t</TT> (or its corresponding
signed type) only.  The proposed resolution is accepted by EWG.</P>
