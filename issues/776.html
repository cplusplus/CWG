<P>[Voted into WP at October, 2009 meeting.]</P>

<P>According to 6.9.3.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.start.dynamic#1">basic.start.dynamic</A>] paragraph 1,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Destructors (11.4.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.dtor">class.dtor</A>]) for initialized objects with
static storage duration are called as a result of returning from
<TT>main</TT> and as a result of calling <TT>std::exit</TT>
(17.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/support.start.term">support.start.term</A>]).

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It is unclear, in the presence of delegating constructors, exactly
what an &#8220;initialized object&#8221; is. 6.7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.life#1">basic.life</A>] paragraph 1
says that the lifetime of an object does not begin until
it is completely initialized, i.e., when its principal constructor
finishes execution. 14.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/except.ctor#2">except.ctor</A>] paragraph 2 says that an
exception during the construction of class object only invokes
destructors for fully-constructed base and member sub-objects (those
for which the principal constructor has completed). On the other hand,
the destructor for a complete class object is called if its
non-delegating constructor has completed, even if the principal
constructor has not yet finished. Which of these models is appropriate
for the behavior of <TT>std::exit</TT>?</P>

<P><B>Notes from the March, 2009 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The CWG agreed that the destructor for a complete object should
be called by <TT>std::exit</TT> if its non-delegating constructor
has finished, just as for an exception.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the July, 2009 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The CWG decided that the direction adopted at the March, 2009
meeting was incorrect. Instead, the model should be the way
completely-constructed base and member subobjects are handled:
their destructors are called when an exception is thrown but not
when <TT>std::exit</TT> is called.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (July, 2009):</B></P>

<P>Change 6.9.3.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.start.dynamic#1">basic.start.dynamic</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>
