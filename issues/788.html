<P>[Voted into WP at March, 2010 meeting.]</P>

<P>According to 5.3.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.charset#3">lex.charset</A>] paragraph 3,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The values of the members of the execution character sets are
implementation-defined, and any additional members
are locale-specific.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This makes it sound as if the locale determines only whether an
extended character (one not in the basic execution character set)
exists, not its value (which is just implementation-defined, not
locale-specific).  The description should be clarified to indicate
that the value of a given character can vary between locales, as
well.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (February, 2010):</B></P>

<P>Change 5.3.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.charset#3">lex.charset</A>] paragraph 3 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

...The<I> execution character set</I> and the <I>execution
wide-character set</I> are <INS>implementation-defined</INS>
supersets of the basic execution character set and the basic
execution wide-character set, respectively.  The values of the
members of the execution character sets <INS>and the sets of
additional members</INS> <DEL>are implementation-defined, and any
additional members</DEL> are locale-specific.
