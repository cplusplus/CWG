<P>Requirements for the alignment of pointers returned by
<I>new-expression</I>s are given in 7.6.2.8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.new#10">expr.new</A>] paragraph 10:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

For arrays of <TT>char</TT> and <TT>unsigned char</TT>, the difference
between the result of the <I>new-expression</I> and the address
returned by the allocation function shall be an integral multiple of
the most stringent alignment requirement (6.8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.types">basic.types</A>])
of any object type whose size is no greater than the size of the array
being created.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The intent of this wording is that the pointer returned by the
<I>new-expression</I> will be suitably aligned for any data type
that might be placed into the allocated storage (since the
allocation function is constrained to return a pointer to
maximally-aligned storage).  However, there is an implicit
assumption that each alignment requirement is an integral multiple
of all smaller alignment requirements.  While this is probably a
valid assumption for all real architectures, there's no reason
that the Standard should require it.</P>

<P>For example, assume that <TT>int</TT> has an alignment requirement
of 3 bytes and <TT>double</TT> has an alignment requirement of 4
bytes.  The current wording only requires that a buffer that is big
enough for an <TT>int</TT> or a <TT>double</TT> be aligned on a 4-byte
boundary (the more stringent requirement), but that would allow the
buffer to be allocated on an 8-byte boundary &#8212; which might
<I>not</I> be an acceptable location for an <TT>int</TT>.</P>

<P>
<U>Suggested resolution</U>: Change "of any object type" to
"of every object type."</P>

<P>A similar assumption can be found in
7.6.1.10 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.reinterpret.cast#7">expr.reinterpret.cast</A>] paragraph 7:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

...converting an rvalue of type "pointer to <TT>T1</TT>" to the type
"pointer to <TT>T2</TT>" (where ... the alignment requirements of
<TT>T2</TT> are no stricter than those of <TT>T1</TT>) and back to its
original type yields the original pointer value...

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<U>Suggested resolution</U>: Change the wording to</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

...converting an rvalue of type "pointer to <TT>T1</TT>" to the type
"pointer to <TT>T2</TT>" (where ...  the alignment requirements of
<INS><TT>T1</TT> are an integer multiple of those of <TT>T2</TT></INS>)
and back to its original type yields the original pointer value...

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The same change would also be needed in paragraph 9.</P>

<P><B>Additional note (June, 2022):</B></P>

<P>Subclause 6.7.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.align#4">basic.align</A>] paragraph 4 specifies:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

... Every alignment value shall be a non-negative integral power of two.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Thus, the situation that a stricter alignment is not an integral
multiple of a weaker alignment does not arise.</P>
