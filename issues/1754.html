<P>There does not appear to be a way to declare (not define) a partial
specialization of a static data member template outside its
class.  The rule for explicit specializations (13.9.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.expl.spec#13">temp.expl.spec</A>] paragraph 13)
 is that the presence or absence of an initializer determines
whether the explicit specialization is a definition or not.  Applying
this rule to the partial specialization case, however, would conflict with
being able to provide an initializer on the declaration within the class.</P>

<P>Do we need to support declaring partial specializations of static
data member templates outside their class?</P>

<P><B>Rationale (February, 2014):</B></P>

<P>CWG felt that this issue is more appropriately considered by EWG.</P>

<P><B>Additional note, April, 2015:</B></P>

<P>EWG has decided not to make a change in this area.  See EWG issue
132.</P>
