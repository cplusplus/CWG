<P>[Adopted as a DR at the November, 2019 meeting.]</P>

<P>According to 11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem#7">class.mem</A>] paragraph 7,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A class is considered a completely-defined object type
(6.8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.types">basic.types</A>]) (or complete type) at the closing
} of the <I>class-specifier</I>. The class is regarded as
complete within its complete-class contexts; otherwise it is
regarded as incomplete within its own
class <I>member-specification</I>.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The complete-class contexts (paragraph 6) include the body
of a member function but not its return and parameter types.
Thus it appears that an example like the following is
ill-formed:</P>

<PRE>
  struct S {
    S f(S s) { return s; }
  };
</PRE>

<P>because of 9.5.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct.def.general#2">dcl.fct.def.general</A>] paragraph 2</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The type of a parameter or the return type for a function
definition shall not be an incomplete or abstract (possibly
cv-qualified) class type in the context of the function
definition unless the function is deleted
(9.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct.def.delete">dcl.fct.def.delete</A>]).

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The words &#8220;in the context of the function
definition&#8221; were added by the resolution of
<A HREF="1824.html">issue 1824</A> to address this
problem, but &#8220;context&#8221; is most naturally
read as referring to the lexical context where the
definition appears rather than within its body.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (October, 2019):</B></P>

<P>Change 9.5.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct.def.general#2">dcl.fct.def.general</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

...The type of a parameter or the return type for a function
definition shall not be <DEL>an incomplete or abstract
(possibly cv-qualified) class type in the context of the
function definition</DEL> <INS>a (possibly cv-qualified)
class type that is incomplete or abstract within the
function body</INS> unless the function is deleted
(9.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct.def.delete">dcl.fct.def.delete</A>]).
