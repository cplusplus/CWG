<P>[Accepted as a DR at the February, 2023 meeting.]</P>

<P>According to 9.11 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.link#5">dcl.link</A>] paragraph 5,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A C language linkage is ignored in determining the language
linkage of class members, friend functions with a
trailing <I>requires-clause</I>, and the function type of
class member functions.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It doesn't make sense that static member functions should
behave like non-static member functions in this regard:</P>

<PRE>
   extern "C" {
     struct A {
       static void f();
       constexpr static void (*p)()=f; //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> error: must point to a function whose type has C language linkage</SPAN>
     };
   }
</PRE>

<P><U>Suggested resolution:</U></P>

<P>Change 9.11 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.link#5">dcl.link</A>] paragraph 5 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A C language linkage is ignored in determining the language
linkage of class members, friend functions with a
trailing <I>requires-clause</I>, and the function type of
<INS>non-static</INS> class member functions.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Notes from the August, 2021 teleconference:</B></P>

<P>There was some question as to whether a linkage
specification should affect the language linkage of any
function declarators within class scope. The question was
also raised as to whether some non-typedef syntax should be
available for affecting language linkage, which would be a
question for EWG.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (approved by CWG 2022-11-10):</B></P>

<P>Change 9.11 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.link#5">dcl.link</A>] paragraph 5 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A C language linkage is ignored in determining the language
linkage of class members, friend functions with a
trailing <I>requires-clause</I>, and the function type of
<INS>non-static</INS> class member functions.
