<P>Given:</P>
<PRE>
    struct S1 {
        int x;
    };

    struct S2 {
        int x;
        double y;
    };

    struct S3 {
        int x;
        double y;
        string s;
    };
</PRE>
Once upon a time, we went through a fairly protracted discussion to ensure
that <TT>S1().x</TT> would be guaranteed to be 0. Note that if we declare
<PRE>
    void f()
    {
        S1 s1;

        // ...
    }
</PRE>
there is no guarantee of the value of <TT>s1.x</TT>, and that is intentional.
But <TT>S1().x</TT> is different, because <TT>S1()</TT> is an rvalue, and
unless all of its members are defined, the effect of copying it is undefined.

<P>Similarly, <TT>S2().x</TT> and <TT>S2().y</TT> are also defined to be
equal to zero, and here it really matters for many implementations, because
if <TT>S2().y</TT> is just a bunch of random bits, it is entirely possible
that trying to copy <TT>S2().y</TT> will yield a floating-point trap.</P>

<P>However, rather to my surprise, the standard does not define the value
of <TT>S3().x</TT> or <TT>S3().y</TT>, because <TT>S3</TT> is not a POD.
It does define <TT>S3().s</TT> (by running the string constructor), but
once a structure is no longer a POD, the values of uninitialized members
are no longer guaranteed in expressions of the form T().</P>

<P>In my opinion, this definition is a mistake, and the committee's intention
was to zero-initialize all members that do not have an explicitly defined
constructor, whether or not the class is a POD.</P>

<P> See also paper J16/99-0014 = WG21 N1191.</P>
