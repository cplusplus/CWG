<P>T and C are used inconsistently throughout these paragraphs.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution [SUPERSEDED]:</B></P>

<OL>

<LI>

<P>Change in 6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.member.lookup#1">class.member.lookup</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A search in a scope X for a name N from a program point P is a single
search in X for N from P unless X is the scope of a class or class
template <DEL>T</DEL> <INS>C</INS>, in which case the following steps
define the result of the search.

<P>Change in 6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.member.lookup#4">class.member.lookup</A>] paragraph 4 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

[<I>Note 2:</I> If <DEL>T</DEL> <INS>C</INS> is incomplete, only base
classes whose <I>base-specifier</I> appears before P are
considered. If <DEL>T</DEL> <INS>C</INS> is an instantiated class, its
base classes are not dependent. &#8212;<I>end note</I>]

<P>Change in 6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.member.lookup#6">class.member.lookup</A>] paragraph 6 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The result of the search is the declaration set of
S(N, <DEL>T</DEL> <INS>C</INS>). If it is an invalid set, the program
is ill-formed.  If it differs from the result of a search
in <DEL>T</DEL> <INS>C</INS> for N in a complete-class context
(11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem">class.mem</A>]) of <DEL>T</DEL> <INS>C</INS>, the program
is ill-formed, no diagnostic required.

<P>Change in 6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.member.lookup#7">class.member.lookup</A>] paragraph 7 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If N is a non-dependent <I>conversion-function-id</I>, conversion
function templates that are members of <DEL>T</DEL> <INS>C</INS> are
considered. For each such template F, the lookup set
S(t, <DEL>T</DEL> <INS>C</INS>) is constructed, considering a function
template declaration to have the name t only if it corresponds to a
declaration of F (6.4.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.scope.scope">basic.scope.scope</A>]).

<P>Change in 6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.member.lookup#8">class.member.lookup</A>] paragraph 8 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

[<I>Note 4:</I> A static member, a nested type or an enumerator
defined in a base class <DEL>T</DEL> <INS><TT>B</TT></INS> can
unambiguously be found even if an object has more than one base class
subobject of type <DEL>T</DEL> <INS><TT>B</TT></INS>. Two base class
subobjects share the non-static member subobjects of their common
virtual base classes. &#8212;<I>end note</I>]

</OL>

<P><B>CWG 2022-12-02</B></P>

<P>The resolution proposed above is incorrect: T is the parameter for
the overall search and C is the parameter for the S(N,C)
construction. Highlight that fact in paragraph 2.</P>

<P>Change in 6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.member.lookup#1">class.member.lookup</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A search in a scope X for a name <DEL>N</DEL> <INS>M</INS> from a
program point P is a single search in X for <DEL>N</DEL> <INS>M</INS>
from P unless X is the scope of a class or class template T, in which
case the following steps define the result of the search.  [<I>Note
1:</I> The result differs only if <DEL>N</DEL> <INS>M</INS> is
a <I>conversion-function-id</I> or if the single search would find
nothing. &#8212;<I>end note</I>]

<P>Change in 6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.member.lookup#2">class.member.lookup</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The lookup set for <INS>a name</INS> N in <INS>a class or class
template</INS> C, called S(N, C), consists of two component sets: the
declaration set, a set of members named N ; and the subobject set, a
set of subobjects where declarations of these members were found
(possibly via <I>using-declaration</I>s). In the declaration set, type
declarations (including injected-class-names) are replaced by the
types they designate. S(N, C) is calculated as follows:

for <DEL>N</DEL> <INS>M</INS> in a complete-class context
