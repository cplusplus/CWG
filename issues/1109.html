<P>It is not always clear when an occurrence of the word &#8220;use&#8221;
is intended as an implicit reference to 6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr">basic.def.odr</A>] and
when it is simply the ordinary English meaning.  This could be addressed
by:</P>

<OL>
<LI><P>Replacing all the non-technical appearances of the word
&#8220;use&#8221; with synonyms such as &#8220;occurrence&#8221; or
&#8220;appearance&#8221; or &#8220;reference to.&#8221;</P></LI>

<LI><P>Following each occurrence of the word &#8220;use&#8221; that
is intended in the technical sense with a cross-reference to
6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr">basic.def.odr</A>].</P></LI>

<LI><P>Replacing all the technical occurrences of the word
&#8220;use&#8221; with a different word or phrase, such as
&#8220;odr-use,&#8221; that would unambiguously indicate the
intent.</P></LI>
