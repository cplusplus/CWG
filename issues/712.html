<P>[Voted into the WP at the February, 2012 meeting;
moved to DR at the October, 2012 meeting.]</P>

<P>In describing static data members initialized inside the class
definition, 11.4.9.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.static.data#3">class.static.data</A>] paragraph 3 says,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The member shall still be defined in a namespace scope if it is
used in the program...

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The definition of &#8220;used&#8221; is in 6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr#1">basic.def.odr</A>] paragraph 1:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

An object or non-overloaded function whose name appears as a
potentially-evaluated expression is <I>used</I> unless it is an
object that satisfies the requirements for appearing in a
constant expression (7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.const">expr.const</A>]) and the
lvalue-to-rvalue conversion (7.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.lval">conv.lval</A>]) is
immediately applied.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Now consider the following example:</P>

<PRE>
    struct S {
      static const int a = 1;
      static const int b = 2;
    };
    int f(bool x) {
      return x ? S::a : S::b;
    }
</PRE>

<P>According to the current wording of the Standard, this example
requires that <TT>S::a</TT> and <TT>S::b</TT> be defined in a
namespace scope.  The reason for this is that, according to
7.6.16 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.cond#4">expr.cond</A>] paragraph 4, the result of this
<I>conditional-expression</I> is an lvalue and the
lvalue-to-rvalue conversion is applied to that, not directly
to the object, so this fails the &#8220;immediately applied&#8221;
requirement.  This is surprising and unfortunate, since only the
values and not the addresses of the static data members are used.
(This problem also applies to the proposed resolution of
<A HREF="696.html">issue 696</A>.)</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (August, 2011):</B></P>

<P>Divide 6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr#2">basic.def.odr</A>] paragraph 2 into two paragraphs
and change as follows:</P>

<P>An expression is <I>potentially evaluated</I> unless it is an
unevaluated operand (Clause 5) or a subexpression thereof. <INS>The
<I>set of potential results</I> of an expression <TT>e</TT> is defined
as:</INS>
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P><INS>if <TT>e</TT> is an <I>id-expression</I>
(_N4567_.5.1.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.prim.general">expr.prim.general</A>]), the set whose sole member is
<TT>e</TT>,</INS></P></LI>

<LI><P><INS>if <TT>e</TT> is a class member access
(7.6.1.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.ref">expr.ref</A>]), the set of potential results of the
object expression,</INS></P></LI>

<LI><P><INS>if <TT>e</TT> is a pointer-to-member expression
(7.6.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.mptr.oper">expr.mptr.oper</A>]) whose second operand is a constant
expression, the set of potential results of the object
expression,</INS></P></LI>

<LI><P><INS>if <TT>e</TT> has the form <TT>(e1)</TT>, the set of
potential results of <TT>e1</TT>,</INS></P></LI>

<LI><P><INS>if <TT>e</TT> is a glvalue conditional expression
(7.6.16 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.cond">expr.cond</A>]), the union of the sets of potential
results of the second and third operands,</INS></P></LI>

<LI><P><INS>if <TT>e</TT> is a comma expression
(7.6.20 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.comma">expr.comma</A>]), the set of potential results of the
right operand,</INS></P></LI>

<LI><P><INS>otherwise, the empty set.</INS></P></LI>

</UL>

<P>A variable <INS><TT>x</TT></INS> whose name appears as a
potentially-evaluated expression <INS><TT>ex</TT></INS> is
<I>odr-used</I> unless <DEL>it</DEL> <INS><TT>x</TT></INS> is an
object that satisfies the requirements for appearing in a constant
expression (7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.const">expr.const</A>]) and <INS><TT>ex</TT> is an
element of the set of potential results of an expression <TT>e</TT>,
where either</INS> the lvalue-to-rvalue conversion (7.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.lval">conv.lval</A>]) is <DEL>immediately</DEL> applied <INS>to <TT>e</TT>, or
<TT>e</TT> is a discarded-value expression (Clause 7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr">expr</A>])</INS>. <TT>this</TT> is odr-used...</P>

<I>[Drafting note: this wording requires <TT>S::a</TT> to be defined
if it is used in an expression like <TT>*&amp;S::a</TT>.]</I>
