Compound assignment of <I>braced-init-list</I>

<P>The specification of 7.6.19 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.ass#9">expr.ass</A>] paragraph 9 is presumably
intended to allow use of a <I>braced-init-list</I> as the operand of a
compound assignment operator as well as a simple assignment operator,
although the normative wording does not explicitly say so.  (The example
in that paragraph does include</P>

<PRE>
  complex&lt;double&gt; z;
  z += { 1, 2 };      //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> meaning </SPAN>z.operator+=({1,2})
</PRE>

<P>for instance, which could be read to imply compound assignment
operators for scalar types as well.)</P>

<P>However, the details of how this is to be implemented are not clear.
Paragraph 7 says,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The behavior of an expression of the form <TT>E1</TT> <I>op</I>
<TT>=</TT> <TT>E2</TT> is equivalent to <TT>E1 = E1</TT> <I>op</I>
<TT>E2</TT> except that <TT>E1</TT> is evaluated only once.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Applying this pattern literally to a <I>braced-init-list</I> yields
invalid code: <TT>x&#160;+=&#160;{1}</TT> would become
<TT>x&#160;=&#160;x&#160;+&#160;{1}</TT>, which is non-syntactic.</P>

<P>Another problem is how to apply the prohibition against narrowing
conversions to a compound assignment.  For example,</P>

<PRE>
  char c;
  c += {1};
</PRE>

<P>would presumably always be a narrowing error, because after integral
promotions, the type of <TT>c+1</TT> is <TT>int</TT>.  The similar
<A HREF="1078.html">issue 1078</A> was classified as "NAD" because
the workaround was simply to add a cast to suppress the error; however,
there is no place to put a similar cast in a compound assignment.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the October, 2012 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The incorrect description of the meaning of a compound assignment
with a <I>braced-init-list</I> should be fixed by CWG.  The question of
whether it makes sense to apply narrowing rules to such assignments
is better addressed by EWG.</P>

<P>See also <A HREF="2399.html">issue 2399</A>.</P>
