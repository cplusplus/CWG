<P>Suppose we've got this class definition:</P>

<PRE>
    struct X {
       void f();
       static int n;
    };
</PRE>

<P>I think I can deduce from the existing standard that the following
member definitions are ill-formed:</P>

<PRE>
    static void X::f() { }
    static int X::n;
</PRE>

<P>To come to that conclusion, however, I have to put together several
things in different parts of the standard.  I would have expected to
find an explicit statement of this somewhere; in particular, I would
have expected to find it in 9.2.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.stc">dcl.stc</A>].  I don't
see it there, or anywhere.</P>

<P>
<U>Gabriel Dos Reis</U>: Or in 6.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.link">basic.link</A>] which is
about linkage.  I would have expected that paragraph to say that that
members of class types have external linkage when the enclosing class
has an external linkage.  Otherwise 6.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.link#8">basic.link</A>] paragraph 8:

</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Names not covered by these rules have no linkage.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>might imply that such members do not have linkage.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the April, 2005 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The question about the linkage of class members is already
covered by 6.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.link#5">basic.link</A>] paragraph 5.</P>
