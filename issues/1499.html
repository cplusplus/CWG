<P>[ Resolved by the changes for <A HREF="1353.html">issue 1353</A>,
accepted as a DR at the June, 2023 meeting. ]</P>

<P>Bullet 4 of 11.4.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.ctor#23">class.copy.ctor</A>] paragraph 23 says that a
defaulted copy/move assignment operator is defined as deleted if the class
has</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

a non-static data member of class type <TT>M</TT> (or array thereof) that
cannot be copied/moved because overload resolution (12.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.match">over.match</A>]), as applied to <TT>M</TT>'s corresponding assignment operator,
results in an ambiguity or a function that is deleted or inaccessible
from the defaulted assignment operator

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The intent of this is that if overload resolution fails to find a
corresponding copy/move assignment operator that can validly be called
to copy/move a member, the class's assignment operator will be defined
as deleted.  However, this wording does not cover an example like the
following:</P>

<PRE>
  struct A {
    A();
  };

  struct B {
    B();
    const A a;
  };

  typedef B&amp; (B::*pmf)(B&amp;&amp;);

  pmf p =&amp;B::operator=;
</PRE>

<P>Here, the problem is simply that overload resolution failed to find
a callable function, which is not one of the cases listed in the current
wording.  A similar problem exists for base classes in the fifth bullet.</P>

<P><B>Additional note (January, 2013):</B></P>

<P>A similar omission exists in paragraph 11 for copy constructors.</P>
