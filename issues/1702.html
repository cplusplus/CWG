<P>11.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.union#5">class.union</A>] paragraph 5 defines an anonymous union as
follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>A union of the form</P>

<UL>
<TT>union {</TT> <I>member-specification</I> <TT>} ;</TT>
</UL>

<P>is called an anonymous union; it defines an unnamed object of unnamed type.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It is obviously intended that a declaration like</P>

<PRE>
    static union { int i; float f; };
</PRE>

<P>is a declaration of that form (cf paragraph 6, which requires the
<TT>static</TT> keyword for anonymous unions declared in namespace
scope).  However, it would be clearer if the definition were recast
in more descriptive terms, e.g.,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

An <I>anonymous union</I> is an unnamed class that is defined with
the <I>class-key</I> <TT>union</TT> in a <I>simple-declaration</I> in
which the <I>init-declarator-list</I> is omitted.  Such a
<I>simple-declaration</I> is treated as if it contained a single
declarator declaring an unnamed variable of the union's type.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>(Note that this definition would require some additional tweaking to
apply to class member anonymous union declarations, since
<I>simple-declaration</I>s are not included
as <I>member-declaration</I>s.)</P>

<P>As a related point, it is not clear how the following examples
are to be treated, and there is implementation variance on some:</P>

<PRE>
   void f() { thread_local union { int a; }; }
   void g() { extern union { int b; }; }
   thread_local union { int c; }; //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> </SPAN>static<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> is implied by </SPAN>thread_local
   static thread_local union { int d; };
   static const union { int e = 0; }; //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> is </SPAN>e<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> const? Clang says yes, gcc says no</SPAN>
   static constexpr union { int f = 0; };
</PRE>

<P><B>Additional notes (July, 2023)</B></P>

<P>This issue is addressed by <A HREF="2767.html">issue 2767</A>.</P>
