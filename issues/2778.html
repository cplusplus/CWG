Trivial destructor does not imply constant destruction

<P>Consider:</P>

<PRE>
  struct Foo {};
  struct Bar {
    mutable Foo f;
  };
  constexpr Bar b{};     //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> #1</SPAN>
</PRE>

<P>In C++20, Foo and Bar are literal types, and #1 is well-formed.  In
C++23, the requirement for the variable <TT>b</TT> changed to
"constant destruction".  However, <TT>Bar</TT> does not have constant
destruction, because its mutable member violates
7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.const#5.17">expr.const</A>] bullet 5.17:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
<LI>...</LI>
<LI>
an invocation of a destructor (11.4.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.dtor">class.dtor</A>]) or a
function call whose <I>postfix-expression</I> names a
pseudo-destructor (7.6.1.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.call">expr.call</A>]), in either case for
an object whose lifetime did not begin within the evaluation of E;
</LI>
<LI>...</LI>
</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This is because the mutable member is considered to have its
lifetime begin outside of E per 7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.const#9">expr.const</A>] paragraph 9:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

An object a is said to have constant destruction if:
<UL>
<LI>it is not
of class type nor (possibly multidimensional) array thereof, or
</LI>
<LI>
it is of class type or (possibly multidimensional) array thereof, that
class type has a constexpr destructor, and for a hypothetical
expression E whose only effect is to destroy a, E would be a core
constant expression if the lifetime of a and its non-mutable
subobjects (but not its mutable subobjects) were considered to start
within E.
</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (reviewed by CWG 2024-03-01):</B></P>

<P>Change in 7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.const#10">expr.const</A>] paragraph 10 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

An object a is said to have constant destruction if:
<UL>
<LI>it is not
of class type nor (possibly multidimensional) array thereof, or
</LI>
<LI>
it is of class type or (possibly multidimensional) array thereof, that
class type has a constexpr destructor, and for a hypothetical
expression E whose only effect is to destroy a, E would be a core
constant expression
<INS>if any invocation of a trivial destructor for a mutable subobject
is ignored and</INS> if the lifetime of a and its non-mutable
subobjects (but not its mutable subobjects) were considered to start
within E.
