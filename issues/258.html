<P>[Voted into WP at April 2003 meeting.]</P>



<P>According to 9.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/namespace.udecl#12">namespace.udecl</A>] paragraph 12,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

When a <I>using-declaration</I> brings names from a base class into a
derived class scope, member functions in the derived class override
and/or hide member functions with the same name and parameter types in
a base class (rather than conflicting).

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Note that this description says nothing about the cv-qualification
of the hiding and hidden member functions.  This means, for instance,
that a non-const member function in the derived class hides a const
member function with the same name and parameter types instead of
overloading it in the derived class scope.  For example,</P>

<PRE>
    struct A {
      virtual int f() const;
      virtual int f();
    };
    struct B: A {
      B();
      int f();
      using A::f;
    };

    const B cb;
    int i = cb.f(); // ill-formed: A::f() const hidden in B

</PRE>

<P>The same terminology is used in 11.7.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.virtual#2">class.virtual</A>] paragraph 2:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If a virtual member function <TT>vf</TT> is declared in a class
<TT>Base</TT> and in a class <TT>Derived</TT>, derived directly or
indirectly from <TT>Base</TT>, a member function <TT>vf</TT> with the
same name and same parameter list as <TT>Base::vf</TT> is declared,
then <TT>Derived::vf</TT> is also virtual (whether or not it is so
declared) and it overrides <TT>Base::vf</TT>.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Notes on the 04/01 meeting:</B></P>

<P> The hiding and overriding should
be on the basis of the function signature, which includes any
cv-qualification on the function.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (04/02):</B></P>

<P>In 9.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/namespace.udecl#12">namespace.udecl</A>] paragraph 12 change:
