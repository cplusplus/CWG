<P>According to 11.7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.abstract#6">class.abstract</A>] paragraph 6,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Member functions can be called from a constructor (or destructor) of
an abstract class; the effect of making a virtual call (11.7.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.virtual">class.virtual</A>]) to a pure virtual function directly or indirectly for
the object being created (or destroyed) from such a constructor (or
destructor) is undefined.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This prohibition is unnecessarily restrictive.  It should not apply
to cases in which the pure virtual function has been defined.</P>

<P>Currently the "pure" specifier for a virtual member function has
two meanings that need not be related:</P>

<OL>

<LI>A pure virtual function need not be defined.</LI>

<LI>A pure virtual function must be overridden in any concrete derived
class.</LI>

</OL>

<P>The prohibition of virtual calls to pure virtual functions arises
from the first meaning and unnecessarily penalizes those who only need
the second.</P>

<P>For example, consider a scenario such as the following.  A class
<TT>B</TT> is defined containing a (non-pure) virtual function
<TT>f</TT> that provides some initialization and is thus called from
the base class constructor.  As time passes, a number of classes are
derived from <TT>B</TT> and it is noticed that each needs to override
<TT>f</TT>, so it is decided to make <TT>B::f</TT> pure to enforce
this convention while still leaving the original definition of
<TT>B::f</TT> to perform its needed initialization.  However, the act
of making <TT>B::f</TT> pure means that every reference to <TT>f</TT>
that might occur during the execution of one of <TT>B</TT>'s
constructors must be tracked down and edited to be a qualified
reference to <TT>B::f</TT>.  This process is tedious and error-prone:
needed edits might be overlooked, and calls that actually should be
virtual when the containing function is called other than during
construction/destruction might be incorrectly changed.</P>

<P>
<B>Suggested resolution:</B> Allow virtual calls to pure virtual
functions if the function has been defined.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (February, 2012):</B></P>

<P>In light of the nontrivial implementation issues such a change
would raise, as well as the fact that this restriction has been
accepted into the C++ design lexicon for many years, CWG decided not
to make a change at this point.  Further consideration, if any,
should occur within EWG.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (February, 2014):</B></P>

<P>EWG determined that no action should be taken on this issue.</P>
