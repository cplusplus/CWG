Definition of &#8220;copy assignment operator&#8221;

<P>Is the following a &#8220;copy assignment operator?&#8221;</P>

<PRE>
    struct A {
        const A&amp; operator=(const A&amp;) volatile;
    };
</PRE>

<P>11.4.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.ctor#9">class.copy.ctor</A>] paragraph 9 doesn't say one way or the
other whether cv-qualifiers on the function are allowed.  (A similar
question applies to the <TT>const</TT> case, but I avoided that example
because it seems so wrong one tends to jump to a conclusion before
seeing what the standard says.)</P>

<P>Since the point of the definition of &#8220;copy assignment
operator&#8221; is to control whether the compiler generates a default
version if the user doesn&#8217;t, I suspect the correct answer is
that neither <TT>const</TT> nor <TT>volatile</TT> cv-qualification
on <TT>operator=</TT> should be allowed for a &#8220;copy assignment
operator.&#8221; A user can write an <TT>operator=</TT> like that, but
it doesn't affect whether the compiler generates the default one.</P>

<P><B>Proposed Resolution (November, 2006):</B></P>

<P>Change 11.4.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.ctor#9">class.copy.ctor</A>] paragraph 9 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A user-declared <I>copy</I> assignment operator <TT>X::operator=</TT>
is a non-static non-template <INS>non-volatile non-const</INS> member
function of class <TT>X</TT> with exactly one parameter of
type <TT>X</TT>, <TT>X&amp;</TT>, <TT>const X&amp;</TT>, <TT>volatile
X&amp;</TT> or <TT>const volatile X&amp;</TT>.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><I>[Drafting note: If a user-declared volatile <TT>operator=</TT>
prevented the implicit declaration of the copy assignment operator,
all assignments for objects of the given class (even to non-volatile
objects) would pay the penalty for volatile write accesses in the
user-declared <TT>operator=</TT>, despite not needing it.]</I></P>

<P><B>Additional note (December, 2008):</B></P>



<P>The proposed resolution addresses only cv-qualified assignment
operators and is silent on ref-qualified versions.  However, it would
seem that the spirit of the resolution would indicate that a ref-qualified
assignment operator would not be considered a copy assignment operator.</P>

<P>There appears to be an emerging idiom that relies on the idea that
providing an lvalue-only assignment operator would prevent assignment
to rvalues:</P>

<PRE>
    struct A {
      A&amp; operator=(const A&amp;) &amp;; // disable assignemt to rvalue
    };
</PRE>

<P>The resolution should also be reconsidered in light of the use of
a const-qualified assignment operator as part of the implementation
of a proxy class, where the proxy object itself is constant and should
not be changed, but the copy assignment operator would apply to the
object to which the proxy object refers.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (March, 2009):</B></P>

<P>It was decided that cv-qualified and ref-qualified assignment
operators should be considered copy assignment operators if they
have the required parameter type.</P>
