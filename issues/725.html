When should the requirement for <TT>std::Returnable&lt;T&gt;</TT>, etc., apply?

<P>If we write</P>

<PRE>
    concept C&lt;class T&gt; {}

    template&lt;C T&gt;
    struct B {
         B f();
         virtual void g() = 0;
    };
</PRE>

<P>... it seems reasonable to expect a diagnostic about
<TT>B&lt;T&gt;::f()</TT> not because it doesn't require
<TT>std::Returnable&lt;B&lt;T&gt;&gt;</TT> (which I think should not
draw an error), but because <TT>g()</TT> is a pure virtual function.
</P>

<P>Now how about this:</P>

<PRE>
    template&lt;C T&gt;
    struct G {
         B&lt;T&gt; f() { return B&lt;T&gt;(); }
    };
</PRE>

<P>Here, I'd like to see an error not because we lack the requirement
<TT>std::Returnable&lt;B&lt;T&gt;&gt;</TT>, but because, when we
instantiate <TT>B&lt;T'&gt;</TT> (as the current wording indicates we
must within the definition of <TT>G&lt;T&gt;::f()</TT>), it turns out
to be an abstract class.</P>

<P>Now, it could be that when we instantiate <TT>G</TT>, we get a
different partial specialization of <TT>B</TT>, and that partial
specialization could have a pure virtual member.  So you might see an
instantiation-time error.  But partial specializations present dangers
like this anyway.</P>

<P>I suggest we make the rule about <TT>Returnable&lt;T&gt;</TT> apply
only in the case where <TT>T</TT> is not an instantiated archetype.
The rationale is that with an instantiated archetype, it's possible to
see at template definition time whether the type is abstract, whereas
with a non-instantiated archetype, the only known attributes come
from requirements.</P>

<P>I suspect we need similar changes for the declarator section.
E.g., for a class template <TT>A</TT>, we shouldn't need to explicitly
require <TT>VariableType&lt;A&lt;T&gt;&gt;</TT> if we want to declare a
variable of type <TT>A&lt;T&gt;</TT>.  Instead, we just instantiate
<TT>A&lt;T'&gt;</TT> (as would be naturally required at the point of
definition of a variable of type <TT>A&lt;T'&gt;</TT>), and issue
errors when appropriate like we do with ordinary classes today.
</P>
