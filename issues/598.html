<P>[Voted into the WP at the March, 2009 meeting.]</P>

<P>The resolution of <A HREF="33.html">issue 33</A> added the
following wording in 6.5.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lookup.argdep">basic.lookup.argdep</A>]:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

In addition, if the argument is the name or address of a set of
overloaded functions and/or function templates, its associated classes
and namespaces are the union of those associated with each of the
members of the set: the namespace in which the function or function
template is defined and the classes and namespaces associated with its
(non-dependent) parameter types and return type.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This wording is self-contradictory: although it claims that the
treatment of overload sets is intended to be &#8220;the union of those
associated with each of the members of the set,&#8221; it says that
the namespace of which each function or function template is a member
is to be considered an associated namespace.  That is different from
the case of a non-overloaded function argument; in that case, because
only the <I>type</I> of the argument is considered, the namespace of
which the function is a member is <I>not</I> an associated namespace.
This should be rectified so that overloaded and unoverloaded functions
really are treated the same.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (June, 2008):</B></P>

<P>Change 6.5.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lookup.argdep#2">basic.lookup.argdep</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

...In addition, if the argument is the name or address of a set
of overloaded functions and/or function templates, its associated
classes and namespaces are the union of those associated with
each of the members of the set<DEL>: the namespace in which the
function or function template is defined and</DEL><INS>, i.e.,</INS>
the classes and namespaces associated with its (non-dependent)
parameter types and return type.
