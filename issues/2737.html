<P>Consider:</P>

<PRE>
  struct S {};
  const S f();
  auto x = [&amp;ref = f()] { return ref; }
</PRE>

<P>Subclause 7.5.6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.prim.lambda.capture#6">expr.prim.lambda.capture</A>] paragraph 6 specifies:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

An <I>init-capture</I> inhabits the lambda scope
(6.4.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.scope.lambda">basic.scope.lambda</A>]) of the <I>lambda-expression</I>.
An <I>init-capture</I> without ellipsis behaves as if it declares and
explicitly captures a variable of the form
<TT>&#8220;auto <I>init-capture</I> ;&#8221;</TT>, except that:

<UL>
<LI>if the capture is by copy (see below), the non-static data member
declared for the capture and the variable are treated as two different
ways of referring to the same object, which has the lifetime of the
non-static data member, and no additional copy and destruction is
performed, and
</LI>
<LI>if the capture is by reference, the variable's lifetime ends when
the closure object's lifetime ends.
</LI>
</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It is unclear whether the temporary returned by <TT>f()</TT> is
lifetime-extended by being bound to a reference init-capture.</P>

<P>There is implementation divergence: gcc rejects the example; clang
accepts and extends the lifetime of the temporary; MSVC and EDG accept
and do not extend the lifetime.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (reviewed by CWG 2024-03-01):</B></P>

<P>Change in 7.5.6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.prim.lambda.capture#6">expr.prim.lambda.capture</A>] paragraph 6 as follows:</P>

if the capture is by reference and the reference would bind to an

ill-formed, and
