<P>[Moved to DR at the April, 2013 meeting.]</P>



<P>According to 11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem#20">class.mem</A>] paragraph 20,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A pointer to a standard-layout struct object, suitably converted
using a <TT>reinterpret_cast</TT>, points to its initial member (or if
that member is a bit-field, then to the unit in which it resides)
and vice versa.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Given a standard-layout struct in which the non-static data members
are in a base class (and hence the derived class is empty), it is not
clear what the &#8220;initial member&#8221; is.  Presumably the intent
behind allowing such standard-layout classes was to treat the base
class object and its first non-static data member as the initial
member of the derived class, but this does not appear to be spelled out
anywhere.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (February, 2012):</B></P>

<P>Change 11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem#20">class.mem</A>] paragraph 20 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<DEL>A pointer to a standard-layout struct object, suitably converted
using a <TT>reinterpret_cast</TT>, points to its initial member (or if
that member is a bit-field, then to the unit in which it resides) and
vice versa.</DEL> <INS>If a standard-layout class object has any
non-static data members, its address is the same as the address of its
first non-static data member. Otherwise, its address is the same as
the address of its first base class subobject (if any).</INS>
