<P>[Voted into WP at March, 2010 meeting.]</P>

<P>According to _N3225_.7.6.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.attr.final#1">dcl.attr.final</A>] paragraph 1, the
<TT>[[final]]</TT> attribute applied to a class is just a shorthand
notation for marking each of the class's virtual functions as
<TT>[[final]]</TT>.  This is different from the similar usage in
other languages, where it means that the class so marked cannot be
used as a base class.  This discrepancy is confusing, and the
definition used by the other languages is more useful.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the March, 2009 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The intent of the <TT>[[final]]</TT> attribute is as an aid in
optimization, to avoid virtual function calls when the final
overrider is known. It is possible to use the <TT>[[final]]</TT>
attribute to prevent derivation by marking the destructor as
<TT>[[final]]</TT>; in fact, as most polymorphic classes will, as
a matter of good programming practice, have a virtual destructor,
marking the class as <TT>[[final]]</TT> will have the effect of
preventing derivation.</P>

<P>Nonetheless, the general consensus of the CWG was to change the
meaning of class <TT>[[final]]</TT> to parallel the usage in other
languages.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (October, 2009):</B></P>

<OL>
<LI><P>Change _N3225_.7.6.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.attr.final#1">dcl.attr.final</A>] paragraph 1 and add a
new paragraph, as follows:</P></LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The <I>attribute-token</I> <TT>final</TT> specifies <INS>derivation
semantics for a class and</INS> overriding semantics for a virtual
function.  It shall appear at most once in each <I>attribute-list</I>
and no <I>attribute-argument-clause</I> shall be present.  The
attribute applies to class definitions and to virtual member functions
being declared in a class definition. <DEL>If the attribute is specified
for a class definition, it is equivalent to being specified for each
virtual member function of that class, including inherited member
functions.</DEL>
</P>

<P><INS>If some class <TT>B</TT> is marked <TT>final</TT> and a class
<TT>D</TT> is derived from <TT>B</TT> the program is
ill-formed.</INS></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI><P>Change the example in _N3225_.7.6.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.attr.final#3">dcl.attr.final</A>] paragraph 3
as follows:</P></LI>

<PRE>
  struct B<INS>1</INS> {
    virtual void f [[ final ]] ();
  };

  struct D<INS>1</INS> : B<INS>1</INS> {
    void f();          //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> ill-formed</SPAN>
  };

<INS>  struct [[ final ]] B2 {
  };

  struct D2 : B2 {    //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> ill-formed</SPAN>
  };</INS>
</PRE>
