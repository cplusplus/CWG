<P>[Voted into the WP at the April, 2007 meeting as part of paper
J16/07-0099 = WG21 N2239.]</P>



<P>A recent GCC bug report
(<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11633">
http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11633</A>)
asks about the validity of
<PRE>
  int count = 23;
  int foo[] = { count++, count++, count++ };
</PRE>
is this undefined or unspecified or something else? I can find nothing in
9.4.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.aggr">dcl.init.aggr</A>] that indicates whether the components of
an initializer-list are evaluated in order or not, or whether they
have sequence points between them.</P>

<P>6.7.8/23 of the C99 std has this to say
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The order in which any side effects occur among the initialization list
expressions is unspecified.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
I think similar wording is needed in 9.4.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.aggr">dcl.init.aggr</A>]</P>

<P>
<U>Steve Adamczyk:</U>
I believe the standard is clear that each initializer
expression in the above is a full-expression
(6.9.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.execution">intro.execution</A>]/12-13; see also
<A HREF="392.html">issue 392</A>) and therefore there is a sequence point
after each expression (6.9.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.execution">intro.execution</A>]/16).  I agree that the
standard does not seem to dictate the order in which the expressions
are evaluated, and perhaps it should.  Does anyone know of a compiler
that would not evaluate the expressions left to right?</P>

<P>
<U>Mike Simons:</U> Actually there is one, that does not do
left to right: gcc/C++.  None of the post increment operations
take effect until after the statement finishes.  So in the sample
code gcc stores 23 into all positions in the array.  The
commercial vendor C++ compilers for AIX, Solaris, Tru64, HPUX
(parisc and ia64), and Windows, all do sequence points at each
',' in the initializer list.</P>
