<P>The concept of odr-use is a static program property, independent of runtime control flow.  For example,</P>

<PRE>
void f() {
  if (false)
    g();          // <SPAN CLASS="cmnt">unconditionally odr-uses </SPAN>g
}
</PRE>

<P>Yet, some parts of the standard talk about an odr-use participating
in the happens-before relation, which is a category error.</P>

<P>Change in 6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr#6">basic.def.odr</A>] paragraph 6 through 8 as follows:</P>

<P>
A structured binding is odr-used <DEL>if it appears as</DEL>
<INS>by</INS> a potentially-evaluated expression <INS><I>E</I> if it
is named by <I>E</I></INS>.
</P>

<P>*this is odr-used if this appears
as a potentially-evaluated expression (including as the result of the
implicit transformation in the body of a non-static member function
(11.4.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mfct.non.static">class.mfct.non.static</A>])).
</P>

<P>
A virtual member function is odr-used if it is not pure. A function is
odr-used <INS>by</INS> <DEL>if it is named by</DEL> a
potentially-evaluated expression or conversion <INS><I>E</I> if it is
named by <I>E</I></INS>. A non-placement allocation or deallocation
function for a class is odr-used by the definition of a constructor of
that class. A non-placement deallocation function for a class is
odr-used by the definition of the destructor of that class, or by
being selected by the lookup at the point of definition of a virtual
destructor (11.4.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.dtor">class.dtor</A>]). [ Footnote: ... ]

<P>Since "odr-use" is a category error here, use the term
"non-initialization use" instead.</P>

<P>...If it is deferred, it strongly happens before any

function or non-inline variable defined in the same translation unit
as the variable to be initialized. [ Footnote: ... ] ...  [ Example:
...  It is implementation-defined whether either a or b is initialized
before main is entered or whether the initializations are delayed
until a is first <DEL>odr-used</DEL> <INS>used</INS> in main. In
particular, if a is initialized before main is entered, it is not
guaranteed that b will be initialized before it
is <DEL>odr-used</DEL> <INS>used</INS> by the initialization of a,
that is, before A::A is called. If, however, a is initialized at some
point after the first statement of main, b will be initialized prior
to its use in A::A. -- end example ]

thread t is sequenced before the first
non-initialization <DEL>odr-use</DEL> <INS>use</INS> by t of any
non-inline variable with thread storage duration ...
