<P>
<TT>decltype</TT> applied to a function call expression
requires a complete type (7.6.1.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.call#3">expr.call</A>] paragraph 3
and 6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr#4">basic.def.odr</A>] paragraph 4), even
though <TT>decltype</TT>'s result might be used in a way
that does not actually require a complete type. This might
cause undesired and excessive template instantiations.
Immediately applying <TT>decltype</TT> should not require a
complete type, for example, for the return type of a
function call.</P>

<P><B>Additional note (October, 2010):</B></P>



<P>Another potential consideration in this question is the use
of the return type in template argument deduction.  If the return
type is a specialization of a class template, one would want an
error occurring in the instantiation of that specialization to
cause a deduction failure, which would argue in favor of requiring
the type to be complete.  (However, that might also be covered by
&#8220;when the completeness of the class type affects the semantics
of the program&#8221; in 13.9.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.inst#1">temp.inst</A>] paragraph 1.)</P>

<P><B>Rationale (November, 2010):</B></P>

<P>The CWG was persuaded by the SFINAE consideration.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B></P>

<P>This issue was raised again at the March, 2011 meeting and paper N3276,
implementing this recommendation, was adopted for the FDIS.</P>
