<P>[Voted into WP at April, 2007 meeting.]</P>

<P>The current wording of 9.4.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.aggr">dcl.init.aggr</A>] paragraph
8 requires that</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

An <I>initializer</I> for an aggregate member that is an empty class
shall have the form of an empty initializer-list <TT>{}</TT>.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This is overly constraining.  There is no reason that the
following should be ill-formed:</P>

<PRE>
    struct S { };
    S s;
    S arr[1] = { s };
</PRE>

<P>
<U>Mike Miller</U>: The wording of 9.4.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.aggr#8">dcl.init.aggr</A>] paragraph 8 is unclear.  &#8220;An aggregate
member&#8221; would most naturally mean &#8220;a member of an
aggregate.&#8221; In context, however, I think it must mean
&#8220;a member [of an aggregate] that is an aggregate&#8221;,
that is, a subaggregate.  Members of aggregates need not
themselves be aggregates (cf paragraph 13 and 11.9.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.expl.init">class.expl.init</A>]); it cannot be the case that an object of an
empty class with a user-declared constructor must be initialized
with <TT>{}</TT> when it is a member of an aggregate.  This
wording should be clarified, regardless of the decision on
Nathan's point.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (October, 2005):</B></P>

<P>This issue is resolved by the resolution of
<A HREF="413.html">issue 413</A>.</P>
