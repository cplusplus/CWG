Layout-compatible POD-struct types

<P>The definition of layout-compatible POD-struct types in
11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem#14">class.mem</A>] paragraph 14
requires that
the two types</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
have the same number of members, and corresponding members (in order)
have layout-compatible types (3.9).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

There does not appear to be any reason for including member functions
and static data members in this requirement.  It would be more logical
to require only that the non-static data members of the two types must
match.

<P>The characteristics of layout-compatible types are not well
described in the current wording, either.  Apart from their use in
11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem#16">class.mem</A>] paragraph 16
to define the
term "common initial sequence," there appears to be nothing said about
which operations are possible between objects of layout-compatible types.
For example, 6.8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.types">basic.types</A>]
paragraphs
2-3 give certain guarantees regarding use of <TT>memcpy</TT> on
objects of the same type; it might be reasonable to assume that the
same kinds of guarantees might apply to objects of layout-compatible
types, but that is not said.  Similarly,
7.2.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lval#15">basic.lval</A>] paragraph 15
describes
permissible "type punning" but does not mention layout-compatible types.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (10/00):</B></P>

<P>In 11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem">class.mem</A>] paragraphs 14 and 15, change all
occurrences of "members" to "nonstatic data members."</P>
