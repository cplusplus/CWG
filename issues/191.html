<P>[Accepted at the November, 2020 meeting as part of paper P1787R6 and
moved to DR at the February, 2021 meeting.]</P>



<P>The current description of unqualified name lookup in
6.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lookup.unqual#8">basic.lookup.unqual</A>] paragraph 8
does
not correctly handle complex cases of nesting.  The Standard
currently reads,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A name used in the definition of a function that is a member function
(9.3) of a class <TT>X</TT> shall be declared in one of the following
ways:

<BR><UL>
<LI>before its use in the block in which it is used or in an enclosing
block (6.3), or</LI>

<LI>shall be a member of class <TT>X</TT> or be a member of a base
class of <TT>X</TT> (10.2), or</LI>

<LI>if <TT>X</TT> is a nested class of class <TT>Y</TT> (9.7), shall
be a member of <TT>Y</TT>, or shall be a member of a base class of
<TT>Y</TT> (this lookup applies in turn to <TT>Y</TT>'s enclosing
classes, starting with the innermost enclosing class), or</LI>

<LI>if <TT>X</TT> is a local class (9.8) or is a nested class of a
local class, before the definition of class <TT>X</TT> in a block
enclosing the definition of class <TT>X</TT>, or</LI>

<LI>if <TT>X</TT> is a member of namespace <TT>N</TT>, or is a nested
class of a class that is a member of <TT>N</TT>, or is a local class
or nested class within a local class of a function that is a member of
<TT>N</TT>, before the member function definition, in namespace
<TT>N</TT> or in one of <TT>N</TT>'s enclosing namespaces.</LI>
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

In particular, this formulation does not handle the following example:

<PRE>
    struct outer {
        static int i;
        struct inner {
            void f() {
                struct local {
                    void g() {
                        i = 5;
                    }
                };
            }
        };
    };
</PRE>

Here the reference to <TT>i</TT> is from a member function of a local
class of a member function of a nested class.  Nothing in the rules
allows <TT>outer::i</TT> to be found, although intuitively it should
be found.

<P>A more comprehensive formulation is needed that allows traversal of
any combination of blocks, local classes, and nested classes.
Similarly, the final bullet needs to be augmented so that a function
need not be a (direct) member of a namespace to allow searching that
namespace when the reference is from a member function of a class
local to that function.  That is, the current rules do not allow the
following example:</P>

<PRE>
    int j;    // global namespace
    struct S {
        void f() {
            struct local2 {
                void g() {
                    j = 5;
                }
            };
        }
    };
</PRE>
