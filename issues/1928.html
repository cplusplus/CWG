Triviality of deleted special member functions

<P>The current wording of the Standard does not make clear whether
a special member function that is defaulted and implicitly deleted is
trivial.  Triviality is visible in various ways that don't involve
invoking the function, such as determining whether a type is
trivially copyable and determining the result of various type traits.
It also factors into some ABI specifications.</P>

<P>(See also <A HREF="1734.html">issue 1734</A>.)</P>

<P><B>Notes from the June, 2014 meeting:</B></P>

<P>CWG felt that deleted functions should be trivial.  See also
<A HREF="1590.html">issue 1590</A>.  </P>

<P><B>Additional note, November, 2014:</B></P>

<P>See paper N4148.</P>

<P><B>Additional note, October, 2015:</B></P>

<P>Moved from "extension" status to "open" to allow consideration
by CWG.  See the additional discussion in
<A HREF="1734.html">issue 1734</A> for further details.  See also
<A HREF="1496.html">issue 1496</A>.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (October, 2015):</B></P>

<P>CWG feels that the triviality of a deleted function should
be irrelevant.  Any cases in which the triviality of a deleted
function is observable should be amended to remove that
dependency.</P>
