Copy/move construction and conversion functions

<P>The current wording of 11.4.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.ctor#31">class.copy.ctor</A>] paragraph 31
refers only to constructors and destructors:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

When certain criteria are met, an implementation is allowed to omit
the copy/move construction of a class object, even if the constructor
selected for the copy/move operation and/or the destructor for the
object have side effects.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>However, in some cases (e.g., <TT>auto_ptr</TT>) a conversion function
is also involved in the copying, and it could presumably also have visible
side effects that would be eliminated by copy elision.  (Some additional
contexts that may also require changes in this regard are mentioned in the
resolution of <A HREF="535.html">issue 535</A>.)</P>

<P><B>Additional note (September, 2012):</B></P>

<P>The default arguments of an elided constructor can also have side
effects and should be mentioned, as well; however, the elision should
not change the odr-use status of functions and variables appearing in
those default arguments. </P>
