<P>[Voted into WP at April 2003 meeting.]</P>

<P>Clause 13 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp#7">temp</A>] paragraph 7
allows class
templates to be declared exported, including member classes and member
class templates (implicitly by virtue of exporting the
containing template class).  However, paragraph 8 does not exclude
exported class templates from the statement that</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
An exported template need only be declared (and not necessarily
defined) in a translation unit in which it is instantiated.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This is an incorrect implication; however, it is also not dispelled in
13.9.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.inst#6">temp.inst</A>] paragraph 6:


<BLOCKQUOTE>
If an implicit instantiation of a class template specialization is
required and the template is declared but not defined, the program is
ill-formed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This wording says nothing about the translation unit in which the
definition must be provided.  Contrast this with
13.9.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.explicit#3">temp.explicit</A>] paragraph 3:


<BLOCKQUOTE>
A definition of a class template or a class member template shall be
in scope at the point of the explicit instantiation of the class
template or class member template.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Suggested resolution:</B></P>

<BR><UL>
<LI>Change Clause 13 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp#8">temp</A>] paragraph 8
to say
that "An exported <INS>non-class</INS> template need only be declared..."</LI>

<LI>Change 13.9.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.inst#6">temp.inst</A>] paragraph 6
to
use wording similar to that of
13.9.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.explicit#3">temp.explicit</A>] paragraph 3
regarding
the requirement for a definition of the class template to be in scope.</LI>
</UL>

<P>(See also <A HREF="212.html">issue 212</A>.)</P>

<P><B>Notes from 04/00 meeting:</B></P>

<P>John Spicer opined that even though Clause 13 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp#7">temp</A>] paragraph 7
speaks of "declaring a class template exported," that does
not mean that the class template is "an exported template" in the
sense of paragraph 8.  He suggested clarifying paragraph 7 to that
effect instead of the change to paragraph 8 suggested above, and
questioned the need for a change to 13.9.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.inst">temp.inst</A>].</P>

<P><B>Notes from the 4/02 meeting:</B></P>

<P>This is resolved by the proposed changes for
<A HREF="323.html">issue 323</A>.</P>
