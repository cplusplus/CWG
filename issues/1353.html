<P>The specification of when a defaulted special member function is to
be defined as deleted sometimes overlooks variant and array members.</P>

<P>Change in 11.4.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.default.ctor#2">class.default.ctor</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A defaulted default constructor for class X is defined as deleted if:

<LI>
<DEL>X is a union that has a variant member with a non-trivial
default constructor and no variant member of X has a default member
initializer,</DEL>
</LI>

<DEL>X is a non-union class that has a variant member M
with a non-trivial default constructor and no variant member of the
anonymous union containing M has a default member initializer,</DEL>
</LI>
<LI>
any non-static data member with no default member initializer
(11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem">class.mem</A>]) is of reference type,

any non-variant non-static data member of const-qualified type

</LI>
<LI>
X is a union and all of its variant members are of const-qualified type (or
<INS>possibly multi-dimensional</INS> array thereof),
</LI>
<LI>
X is a non-union class and all members of any
anonymous union member are of const-qualified type (or <INS>possibly multi-dimensional</INS> array thereof),
</LI>
<LI>
any potentially constructed subobject, except for a non-static data
member with a <I>brace-or-equal-initializer</I> <INS>or a variant
member of a union where another non-static data member has
a <I>brace-or-equal-initializer</I></INS>, has class type M

<BLOCKQUOTE>

... A defaulted copy/move constructor for a class X is
defined as deleted (9.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct.def.delete">dcl.fct.def.delete</A>]) if X has:
<UL>

<DEL>that cannot be copied/moved because</DEL> <INS>for which</INS>
overload resolution (12.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.match">over.match</A>]), as applied to find

constructor</DEL> <INS>either does not result in a usable candidate

<DEL>a variant member whose corresponding constructor as selected by
overload resolution is non-trivial,</DEL>

<LI>
any potentially constructed subobject of <DEL>a type with</DEL>
<INS>class type M (or possibly multi-dimensional array thereof) where M has</INS> a

<P>Change in 11.4.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.assign#7">class.copy.assign</A>] paragraph 7 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A defaulted copy/move assignment operator for class X is defined as
deleted if X has:
<UL>
<LI>
<DEL>a variant member with a non-trivial
corresponding assignment operator and X is a union-like class, or</DEL>
</LI>
<LI>
a non-static data member of const non-class type (or
<INS>possibly multi-dimensional</INS> array thereof), or
</LI>
<LI>
a non-static data member of reference type, or
</LI>
<LI>
a direct non-static data member of class type M (or <INS>possibly
multi-dimensional</INS> array thereof) or a direct base class M that
cannot be copied/moved because overload resolution
(12.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.match">over.match</A>]), as applied to find M's corresponding
assignment operator, <DEL>results in an ambiguity or a function that

operator</DEL> <INS>either does not result in a usable candidate

<P>Change in 11.4.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.dtor#7">class.dtor</A>] paragraph 7 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A defaulted destructor for a class X is defined as deleted if:
<UL>
<LI>
<DEL>X is a union-like class that has a variant member with a non-trivial
destructor,</DEL>
</LI>
<LI>
any potentially constructed subobject has class
type M (or <INS>possibly multi-dimensional</INS> array thereof) and M has a <DEL>deleted</DEL> destructor <INS>that is deleted</INS> or <DEL>a
destructor that</DEL> is inaccessible from the defaulted destructor
<INS>or, in the case of a variant member, is non-trivial</INS>,
</LI>

function results in an ambiguity or in a function that is deleted or
