<P>Prior to
<A HREF="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0137r1.html">P0137R1</A>,
the term "object" was defined to be "a region of storage".  Currently,
the term "object" appears to be missing a definition.  The submitter
suggests to restore wording similar to "An object is a region of
storage that is occupied or released, associated with an object type
and certain properties." and disagrees with the resolutions suggested
below.</P>

<P><U>Possible resolution (option 1) [SUPERSEDED]:</U></P>

<P>Change in 6.7.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.object#1">intro.object</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

the abstract machine (4.1.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.abstract">intro.abstract</A>]).</INS> The
constructs in a C++ program create, destroy, refer to, access, and
