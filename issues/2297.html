<P>It is not sufficiently clear that the only atomic operations are the
ones defined in 32.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/atomics">atomics</A>] by the library. The intent
is that no accesses are atomic unless the Standard describes them as
such.</P>

<P>An additional problem is that, e.g., <TT>new</TT> and <TT>delete</TT>
are defined to be synchronization operations, but they are not defined
in Clauses 32.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/atomics">atomics</A>] and Clause 32 [<A href="https://wg21.link/thread">thread</A>].
</P>

<P><U>Suggested resolution:</U></P>

<P>Change 6.9.2.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.races#3">intro.races</A>] paragraph 3 as follows:</P>

The library defines <DEL>a number</DEL> <INS>the set</INS> of atomic
operations (32.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/atomics">atomics</A>])<DEL> and operations on mutexes
(Clause 32 [<A href="https://wg21.link/thread">thread</A>]) that</DEL><INS>. Some of these, and some
other library operations, such as those on mutexes (
Clause 32 [<A href="https://wg21.link/thread">thread</A>])</INS> are specially identified as synchronization
operations. These operations...

<P><B>Notes from the April, 2017 teleconference:</B></P>

<P>CWG determined that this issue should be handled
editorially; it will be in "review" status until the change
has been made and verified.  See
<A HREF="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/1611">editorial
issue 1611</A>.</P>

<P><B>Additional notes, October, 2018:</B></P>

<P>This is also
<A HREF="http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/lwg-active.html#2506">
library issue 2506</A>. SG1 has requested a paper to deal with this
issue, so it is no longer considered editorial.
