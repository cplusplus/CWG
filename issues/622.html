<P>The relational operators have unspecified results when comparing
pointers that refer to objects that are not members of the same object
or elements of the same array (7.6.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.rel#2">expr.rel</A>] paragraph 2,
second bullet).  This restriction (which dates from C89) stems from
the desire not to penalize implementations on architectures with
segmented memory by forcing them essentially to simulate a flat
address space for the purpose of these comparisons.  If such an
implementation requires that objects and arrays to fit within a single
segment, this restriction enables pointer comparison to be done simply
by comparing the offset portion of the pointers, which could
be <I>much</I> faster than comparing the full pointer values.</P>

<P>The problem with this restriction in C++ is that it forces users of
the Standard Library containers to use <TT>less&lt;T*&gt;</TT> instead
of the built-in <TT>&lt;</TT> operator to provide a total ordering on
pointers, a usage that is inconvenient and error-prone.  Can the
existing restriction be relaxed in some way to allow the built-in
operator to provide a total ordering?  (John Spicer pointed out that
the actual comparison for a segmented architecture need only supply a
total ordering of pointer values, not necessarily the complete
linearization of the address space.)</P>

<P><B>Rationale (April, 2007):</B></P>

<P>The current specification is clear and was well-motivated.
Analysis of whether this restriction is still needed should be done
via a paper and discussed in the Evolution Working Group rather than
being handled by CWG as an issue/defect.</P>

<P><B>Additional note, April, 2015:</B></P>

<P>EWG has decided not to make a change in this area.  See EWG issue
91.</P>
