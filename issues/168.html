<P>[Picked up by evolution group at October 2002 meeting.]</P>

<P>9.11 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.link#4">dcl.link</A>] paragraph 4
says,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A C language linkage is
ignored for the names of class members and the member function types of
class member functions.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This makes good sense, since C linkage names
typically aren't compatible with the naming used for member functions at
link time, nor is C language linkage function type necessarily compatible
with the calling convention for passing <TT>this</TT> to a non-static member
function.

<P>But C language linkage type (not name) for a static member function is
invaluable for a common programming idiom. When calling a C function that
takes a pointer to a function, it's common to use a private static member
function as a "trampoline" which retrieves an object reference (perhaps by
casting) and then calls a non-static private member function. If a static
member function can't have a type with C language linkage, then a global or
friend function must be used instead. These alternatives expose more of a
class's implementation than a static member function; either the friend
function itself is visible at namespace scope alongside the class definition
or the private member function must be made public so it can be called by a
non-friend function.</P>

<P>Suggested Resolution: Change the sentence cited above
to:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A C language linkage is ignored for the names of class members and the
member function types of <INS>non-static</INS> class member functions.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The example
need not be changed because it doesn't involve a static member function.

<P>The following workaround accomplishes the goal of not exposing
the class's implementation, but at the cost of significant
superstructure and obfuscation:</P>

<PRE>
    // foo.h
    extern "C" typedef int c_func(int);
    typedef int cpp_func(int);
    class foo
    {
    private:
      c_func* GetCallback();
      static int Callback(int);
    };

    // foo.cpp
    #include "foo.h"

    // A local pointer to the static member that will handle the callback.
    static cpp_func* cpp_callback=0;

    // The C function that will actually get registered.
    extern "C" int CFunk(int i)
    {
      return cpp_callback(i);
    }

    c_func* foo::GetCallback()
    {
      cpp_callback = &amp;Callback;    // Only needs to be done once.
      return &amp;CFunk;
    }
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Rationale (10/99):</B> The Standard correctly reflects the
intent of the Committee.</P>

<P><B>Note (March, 2008):</B></P>

<P>The Evolution Working Group recommended closing this issue with no
further consideration.  See paper J16/07-0033 = WG21 N2173.</P>
