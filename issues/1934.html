<P>According to 14.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/except.spec#4">except.spec</A>] paragraph 4,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If any declaration of a function has an <I>exception-specification</I> that
is not a <I>noexcept-specification</I> allowing all exceptions, all
declarations, including the definition and any explicit specialization, of
that function shall have a compatible <I>exception-specification</I>.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This seems excessive for explicit specializations, considering that
paragraph 6 applies a looser requirement for virtual functions:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If a virtual function has an <I>exception-specification</I>, all
declarations, including the definition, of any function that overrides that
virtual function in any derived class shall only allow exceptions that are
allowed by the <I>exception-specification</I> of the base class virtual
function.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The rule in paragraph 3 is also problematic in regard to
explicit specializations of destructors and defaulted special member
functions, as the implicit <I>exception-specification</I> of the
template member function cannot be determined.</P>

<P>There is also a related problem with defaulted special
member functions and <I>exception-specification</I>s.
According to 9.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct.def.default#3">dcl.fct.def.default</A>] paragraph 3,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If a function that is explicitly defaulted has an
explicit <I>exception-specification</I> that is not
compatible (14.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/except.spec">except.spec</A>]) with
the <I>exception-specification</I> on the implicit
declaration, then</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>if the function is explicitly defaulted on its first
declaration, it is defined as deleted;</P></LI>

<LI>

<P>otherwise, the program is ill-formed.</P>
</LI>

</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This rule precludes defaulting a virtual base class
destructor or copy/move functions if the derived class function
will throw an exception not allowed by the implicit base class
member function.</P>

<PP><B>Rationale (June, 2014):</B></PP>

<P>This request for a language extension should be evaluated by
EWG before any action is taken.</P>

<P><B>Additional note, November, 2020:</B></P>

<P>This request applied to full exception specifications and
is no longer relevant in the current language, where only
<I>noexcept-specifier</I>s are permitted.</P>

<P><B>EWG 2022-11-11</B></P>

<P>Close as NAD.</P>
