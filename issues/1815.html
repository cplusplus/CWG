<P>[Moved to DR at the November, 2014 meeting.]</P>



<P>With the recent addition of <I>brace-or-equal-initializer</I>s to
aggregates and the presumed resolution for
<A HREF="1696.html">issue 1696</A>, it is not clear how
lifetime extension of temporaries should work in aggregate
initialization.  For example:</P>

<PRE>
  struct A { };
  struct B { A&amp;&amp; a { A{} } };
  B b;         //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> #1</SPAN>
  B b{ A{} };  //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> #2</SPAN>
  B b{};       //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> #3</SPAN>
</PRE>

<P>#1 is default initialization, so (presumably) the lifetime of the
temporary persists only until <TT>B</TT>'s default constructor
exits.  #2 is aggregate initialization, which binds <TT>B::a</TT> to
the temporary in the initializer for <TT>b</TT> and thus extends its
lifetime to that of <TT>b</TT>.  #3 is aggregate initialization, but
it is not clear whether the lifetime of the temporary in the
non-static data member initializer for <TT>B::a</TT> should be
lifetime-extended like #2 or not, like #1.</P>

<P>One possibility might be to extend the lifetime in #3 but to give
<TT>B</TT> a deleted default constructor since it would extend the
lifetime of a temporary.</P>

<P>See also <A HREF="1696.html">issue 1696</A>.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the February, 2014 meeting:</B></P>

<P>CWG agreed with the suggested direction, which would treat #3 in the
example like #2 and make the default constructor deleted, resulting
in #1 being ill-formed.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (June, 2014):</B></P>

<P>This issue is resolved by the resolution of
<A HREF="1696.html">issue 1696</A>.</P>
