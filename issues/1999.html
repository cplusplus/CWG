<P>[Moved to DR at the May, 2015 meeting.]</P>



<P>According to 5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.phases#1">lex.phases</A>] paragraph 1, first phase,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Any source file character not in the basic source character
set (5.3.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.charset">lex.charset</A>]) is replaced by the
universal-character-name that designates that character. (An
implementation may use any internal encoding, so long as an
actual extended character encountered in the source file,
and the same extended character expressed in the source file
as a universal-character-name (i.e., using
the <TT>\uXXXX</TT> notation), are handled equivalently
except where this replacement is reverted in a raw string
literal.)

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This wording is obviously not intended to exclude the use of
characters with code points larger than <TT>0xffff</TT>, but
the reference to &#8220;the <TT>\uXXXX</TT> notation&#8221; might
suggest that the <TT>\Uxxxxxxxx</TT> form is not allowed.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (April, 2015):</B></P>

<P>Change 5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.phases#1">lex.phases</A>] paragraph 1 number 1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

...(An implementation may use any internal encoding, so long as
an actual extended character encountered in the source file, and
the same extended character expressed in the source file as a
universal-character-name (<DEL>i.e.</DEL> <INS>e.g.</INS>, using
the <TT>\uXXXX</TT> notation), are handled equivalently except
where this replacement is reverted in a raw string literal.)
