<P>(From submission
<A HREF="https://github.com/cplusplus/CWG/issues/402">#402</A>.)</P>

<P>Consider the following tokens appearing in multiple translation units:</P>

<PRE>
 inline void f() {
   int a;
   int b = a;
 }
</PRE>

<P>Does <TT>f</TT> violate the one-definition rule?</P>

<P>We have this check in 6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr#14.5">basic.def.odr</A>] paragraph 14.5:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
<LI>...</LI>
<LI>In each such definition, corresponding names, looked up according to
6.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lookup">basic.lookup</A>], shall refer to the same entity, ...</LI>
<LI>...</LI>
</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Does <TT>a</TT> refer to the same entity in the several definitions
of <TT>f</TT>? Subclause 6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr#16">basic.def.odr</A>] paragraph 16
specifies:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

These requirements also apply to corresponding entities defined within
each definition of D (including the closure types
of <I>lambda-expression</I>s, but excluding entities defined within
default arguments or default template arguments of either D or an
entity not defined within D). For each such entity and for D itself,
the behavior is as if there is a single entity with a single
definition, including in the application of these requirements to
other entities.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Thus, the requirements apply recursively to the definitions
of <TT>a</TT>, but it is unclear whether the conclusion "as if there
is a single entity with a single definition" is reached at each level
of the recursion separately.</P>

<P><U>Suggested resolution:</U></P>

<P>Change in 6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr#16">basic.def.odr</A>] paragraph 16 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<INS>If these requirements are satisfied, the behavior for <TT>D</TT>
is as if there is a single entity with a single definition, including
in the application of these requirements to other entities.</INS>
<DEL>These requirements</DEL> <INS>This behavior</INS>
also <DEL>apply</DEL> <INS>applies</INS> to corresponding entities
defined within each definition of D (including the closure types
of <I>lambda-expression</I>s, but excluding entities defined within
default arguments or default template arguments of either D or an
entity not defined within D). <DEL>For each such entity and for D
itself, the behavior is as if there is a single entity with a single
definition, including in the application of these requirements to
other entities.</DEL>
