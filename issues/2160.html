<P>(From <A HREF="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/523">this
editorial issue</A>.)</P>

<P><B>Consistency of deduced values</B></P>

<PRE>
  template &lt;typename T&gt; void foo(T, T); //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> (1)</SPAN>
  template &lt;typename T, typename U&gt; void foo(T, U); //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> (2)</SPAN>
</PRE>

<P>13.10.3.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.deduct.type#2">temp.deduct.type</A>] paragraph 2 makes it clear
that there must be exactly one set of deduced values for the
<TT>P</TT>s. But there is no such statement in the partial ordering
rule. The algorithm described only does pairwise <TT>P</TT>/<TT>A</TT>
matching, so a synthesized call from (2) to (1) via <TT>foo(U{},
V{})</TT> could succeed in deduction. Both gcc and clang agree
that (1) is more specialized.</P>

<P><B>Type Synthesis Template Instantiation</B></P>

<PRE>
  template &lt;typename T&gt;
  struct identity { using type = T; };

  template&lt;typename T&gt; void bar(T, T ); //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> (1) </SPAN>
  template&lt;typename T&gt; void bar(T, typename identity&lt;T&gt;::type ); //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> (2)</SPAN>
</PRE>

<P>Here, if synthesized for (2) <TT>Unique2</TT> and <TT>typename
identity&lt;Unique2&gt;::type == Unique2</TT> , then type
deduction would succeed in both directions and the call
<TT>bar(0,0)</TT> would be ambiguous. However, it seems that
both compilers instead simply treat <TT>typename
identity&lt;Unique2&gt;::type</TT> as <TT>Unique2_b</TT>,
thus making template deduction from (2) to (1) fail (based
on the implied missing Consistency rule).</P>

<P><B>Non-deduced Context Omission</B></P>

<P>This is the same as the previous example, except now define</P>

<PRE>
  template &lt;typename T&gt; struct identity;
  template &lt;&gt; struct identity&lt;int&gt; { using type = int; };
</PRE>

<P>With no template instantiation during synthesis and
consistency, the (2) ==&gt; (1) deduction fails. But if we
consider the (1) ==&gt; (2) call, we'd match <TT>T</TT> against
<TT>Unique1</TT> and then have the non-deduced
context <TT>typename identity&lt;Unique1&gt;::type</TT> to
match against <TT>Unique1</TT>, but that would be a
substitution failure. It seems that the approach taken by
gcc and clang (both of which prefer (1) here) is to ignore
the non-deduced context argument, as long as that parameter
type is deduced from a different template parameter type
that did get matched.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the February, 2016 meeting:</B></P>

<P>None of these examples appears to reflect a defect in the
current wording; in particular, the second and third
examples involve a dependent type and there could be a later
specialization of <TT>identity</TT>, so it's impossible to
reason about those cases in the template definition
context. The issue will be left open to allow for possible
clarification of the intent of the wording.</P>
