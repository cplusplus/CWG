<P>[Accepted as a DR at the June, 2018 (Rapperswil) meeting.]</P>



<P>According to 11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem#25">class.mem</A>] paragraph 25,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If a standard-layout class object has any non-static data members, its
address is the same as the address of its first non-static data
member. Otherwise, its address is the same as the address of its first base
class subobject (if any). [<I>Note:</I> There might therefore be unnamed
padding within a standard-layout struct object, but not at its beginning,
as necessary to achieve appropriate alignment. &#8212;<I>end note</I>]
[<I>Note:</I> The object and its first subobject are
pointer-interconvertible (6.8.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.compound">basic.compound</A>],
7.6.1.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.static.cast">expr.static.cast</A>]). &#8212;<I>end note</I>]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This wording does not consider the case when the first non-static
data member is a bit-field, which cannot have its address taken.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution, February, 2018: [SUPERSEDED]</B></P>

<P>Change 11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem#25">class.mem</A>] paragraph 25 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

address is the same as the address of its first non-static data
member <INS>if that member is not a bit-field</INS>. <DEL>Otherwise, its</DEL>
<INS>Its</INS> address is <INS>also</INS> the same as the address
of <INS>each of</INS> its <DEL>first</DEL> base class subobject<INS>s</INS>
<DEL>(if any)</DEL>. [<I>Note:</I> There might therefore be unnamed padding

<P><B>Notes from the March, 2018 meeting:</B></P>

<P>It was pointed out that the definition of pointer interconvertibility
in 6.7.6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.thread#4">basic.stc.thread</A>] paragraph 4 refers to &#8220;the first base
class subobject&#8221; of the object and must also be updated to reflect
the above proposed resolution.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (March, 2018):</B></P>

<OL>
<LI><P>Change 6.8.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.compound#4.3">basic.compound</A>] bullet 4.3 as follows:</P></LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Two objects a and b are <I>pointer-interconvertible</I> if:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>...</P></LI>

<LI><P>one is a standard-layout class object and the other is the first
non-static data member of that object, or, if the object has no non-static
data members, <DEL>the first</DEL> <INS>any</INS> base class subobject of
that object (11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem">class.mem</A>]), or</P></LI>
