<P>[Voted into WP at March, 2010 meeting.]</P>



<P>Since members of the basic source character set can be written inside
a string using a universal character name, it is not clear whether a UCN
that represents <TT>']'</TT> or one of the characters in the terminating
<I>d-char-sequence</I> should be interpreted as that character or as
an attempt to &#8220;escape&#8221; that character and prevent its
interpretation as part of the terminating sequence of a raw character
string.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the July, 2009 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The CWG supported a resolution in which the <I>d-char-sequence</I>
of a raw string literal is considered to be outside the literal and
thus, by 5.3.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.charset#2">lex.charset</A>] paragraph 2, could not contain a UCN
designating a member of the basic source character set.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (October, 2009):</B></P>

<P>Change 5.3.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.charset#2">lex.charset</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Additionally, if the hexadecimal value for a universal-character-name
outside <INS>the <I>c-char-sequence</I>, <I>s-char-sequence</I>, or
<I>r-char-sequence</I> of</INS> a character or string literal
corresponds to a control character (in either of the ranges 0x00-0x1F
or 0x7F-0x9F, both inclusive) or to a character in the basic source
character set, the program is ill-formed.
