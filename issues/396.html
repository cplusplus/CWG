<P>[Voted into WP at March 2004 meeting.]</P>



<P>BTW, I noticed that the following note in 9.2.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.stc#2">dcl.stc</A>] paragraph 2
doesn't seem to have
made it onto the issues list or into the TR:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  [Note: hence, the auto specifier is almost always redundant and not
  often used; one use of auto is to distinguish a declaration-statement
  from an expression-statement (stmt.ambig) explicitly. --- end note]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I thought that this was well known to be incorrect, because using auto
does not disambiguate this. Writing:
<PRE>
  auto int f();
</PRE>
is still a declaration of a function f, just now with an error since the
function's return type may not use an auto storage class specifier. I
suppose an error is an improvement over a silent ambiguity going the
wrong way, but it's still not a solution for the user who wants to
express the other in a compilable way.</P>

<P>Proposed resolution: Replace that note with the following note:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  [Note: hence, the auto specifier is always redundant and not often
  used. --- end note]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<U>John Spicer</U>:
I support the proposed change, but I think the disambiguation case is not the
one that you describe.  An example of the supposed disambiguation is:</P>
<PRE>
  int i;
  int j;
  int main()
  {
    int(i);  // declares i, not reference to ::i
    auto int(j);  // declares j, not reference to ::j
  }
</PRE>
<P>
cfront would take "int(i)" as a cast of ::i, so the auto would force what it
would otherwise treat as a statement to be considered a declaration
(cfront 3.0 warned that this would change in the future).</P>

<P>In a conforming compiler the auto is always redundant (as you say) because
anything that could be considered a valid declaration should be treated as
one.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (April 2003):</B></P>

<P>Replace 9.2.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.stc#2">dcl.stc</A>] paragraph 2
