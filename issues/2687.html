<P>[ Resolved by paper P2797R0, adopted in February 2023. ]</P>

<P>Subclause 12.2.2.2.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.match.call.general#2">over.match.call.general</A>] paragraph 2 specifies:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If the <I>postfix-expression</I> is the address of an overload set,
overload resolution is applied using that set as described above. If
the function selected by overload resolution is a non-static member
function, the program is ill-formed.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>However, 7.6.2.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.unary.op#3">expr.unary.op</A>] paragraph 3 states that the
address of an explicit object member function is a plain pointer to
function, not a pointer to member.  The former can be invoked using
the regular function call syntax (7.6.1.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.call">expr.call</A>])
without the need for a pointer-to-member expression
(7.6.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.mptr.oper">expr.mptr.oper</A>]).  For example, absent any overloading and
given some function <TT>f</TT>, the
expression <TT>(&amp;A::f)(A())</TT> could be valid if <TT>f</TT> is a
static member function or an explicit object member function.
However, that expression cannot possibly be valid if <TT>f</TT> is an
implicit object member function.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (approved by CWG 2023-01-27):</B></P>

<P>Change in 12.2.2.2.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.match.call.general#2">over.match.call.general</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If the <I>postfix-expression</I> is the address of an overload set,
overload resolution is applied using that set as described above. If
the function selected by overload resolution is
<DEL>a non-static</DEL> <INS>an implicit object</INS> member function,
the program is ill-formed.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>EWG 2023-02-06</B></P>

<P>Subclause 12.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.over#4">over.over</A>] paragraph 4 says that
explicit-object member functions match both kinds of pointer type, and
11.4.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mfct.non.static#2">class.mfct.non.static</A>] paragraph 2 seems to try to
transform <TT>(&amp;A::f)(A())</TT>
into <TT>(&amp;(*this).A::f)(A())</TT> if <TT>f</TT> is an
explicit-object member function.</P>


<P>
<B>Editor's observation:</B> 12.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.over#4">over.over</A>] paragraph 4 was a
missed edit applying P0847R7; it was rectified with commit
<A HREF="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/0c9dd96bbfc421a0feabcbc2b6850cd369ed181f">0c9dd96bb</A>
on 2023-01-17.</P>

<P><B>Additional notes (March, 2023)</B></P>

<P>The concern about incorrectly applying the <TT>this</TT>
transformation was addressed by P2797R0 (Proposed resolution for
<A HREF="2692.html">CWG2692</A> Static and explicit object member
functions with the same parameter-type-lists).</P>
