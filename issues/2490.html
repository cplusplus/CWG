<P>[Accepted as a DR at the October, 2021 meeting.]</P>

<P>According to 7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.const#6">expr.const</A>] paragraph 6,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>For the purposes of determining whether an
expression <I>E</I> is a core constant expression, the
evaluation of a call to a member function of
<TT>std::allocator&lt;T&gt;</TT> as defined in
20.2.10.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/allocator.members">allocator.members</A>], where <TT>T</TT> is a
literal type, does not disqualify <I>E</I> from being a core
constant expression, even if the actual evaluation of such a
call would otherwise fail the requirements for a core
constant expression. Similarly, the evaluation of a call to
<TT>std::destroy_at</TT>, <TT>std::ranges::destroy_at</TT>,
<TT>std::construct_at</TT>,
or <TT>std::ranges::construct_at</TT> does not
disqualify <TT>E</TT> from being a core constant expression
unless:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>for a call to <TT>std::construct_at</TT> or
<TT>std::ranges::construct_at</TT>, the first argument, of
type <TT>T*</TT>, does not point to storage allocated with
<TT>std::allocator&lt;T&gt;</TT> or to an object whose
lifetime began within the evaluation of <I>E</I>, or the
evaluation of the underlying constructor call
disqualifies <I>E</I> from being a core constant expression,
or</P></LI>

<LI><P>for a call to <TT>std::destroy_at</TT> or
<TT>std::ranges::destroy_at</TT>, the first argument, of
type <TT>T*</TT>, does not point to storage allocated with
<TT>std::allocator&lt;T&gt;</TT> or to an object whose
lifetime began within the evaluation of <I>E</I>, or the
evaluation of the underlying destructor call
disqualifies <I>E</I> from being a core constant
expression.</P></LI>

</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>There are, however, no specific restrictions in
7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.const">expr.const</A>] regarding destructor or
pseudo-destructor calls. In particular, a constexpr
destructor can be called for any object, regardless of
how it was constructed or the start of its lifetime,
and similarly for pseudo-destructor calls. This seems
inconsistent.</P>

<P>If those restrictions are added, would the specific
restrictions on library destruction facilities still be
needed?</P>

<P><B>Notes from the August, 2021 teleconference:</B></P>

<P>CWG agreed that since trivial destructors and
pseudo-destructors are now considered to end the lifetime of
the object for which they are called, they should be
prohibited from being invoked for a runtime object in a
constant expression.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (August, 2021):</B></P>

<OL>
<LI><P>Change 7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.const#5">expr.const</A>] paragraph 5 as follows:</P></LI>

<P>An expression <I>E</I> is a <I>core constant expression</I>
unless the evaluation of <I>E</I>, following the rules of the
abstract machine (6.9.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.execution">intro.execution</A>]), would
evaluate one of the following:</P>

7.6.2.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.pre.incr">expr.pre.incr</A>]) unless it is applied to a
non-volatile lvalue of literal type that refers to a
non-volatile object whose lifetime began within the
evaluation of <I>E</I>;</P></LI>

(7.6.1.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.call">expr.call</A>]), in either case for an
