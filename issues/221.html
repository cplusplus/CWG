<P>[Moved to DR at 4/01 meeting.]</P>

<P>Is the intent of 12.4.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.ass#1">over.ass</A>] paragraph 1 that
<I>all</I> assignment operators be non-static member functions
(including <TT>operator+=</TT>, <TT>operator*=</TT>, etc.) or only
simple assignment operators (<TT>operator=</TT>)?</P>

<P><B>Notes from 04/00 meeting:</B></P>

<P>Nearly all references to "assignment operator" in the IS mean
<TT>operator=</TT> and not the compound assignment operators.  The ARM
was specific that this restriction applied only to <TT>operator=</TT>.
If it did apply to compound assignment operators, it would be
impossible to overload these operators for <TT>bool</TT> operands.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (04/01):</B></P>

<OL>
<LI><P>Change the title of 7.6.19 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.ass">expr.ass</A>] from "Assignment
operators" to "Assignment and compound assignment operators."</P></LI>

<LI>
<P>Change the first sentence of 7.6.19 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.ass#1">expr.ass</A>] paragraph 1
from</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

There are several assignment operators, all of which group
right-to-left.  All require a modifiable lvalue as their left operand,
and the type of an assignment expression is that of its left operand.
The result of the assignment operation is the value stored in the left
operand after the assignment has taken place; the result is an lvalue.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The assignment operator (<TT>=</TT>) and the compound assignment
operators all group right-to-left.  All require a modifiable lvalue as
their left operand and return an lvalue with the type and value of
the left operand after the assignment has taken place.

<P>
<B>Additional note (10/00):</B> Paragraphs 2-6 of
7.6.19 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.ass">expr.ass</A>] should all be understood to apply to
simple assignment only and not to compound assignment operators.</P>
