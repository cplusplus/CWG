<P>According to 7.6.16 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.cond#4">expr.cond</A>] paragraph 4,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Attempts are made to form an implicit conversion sequence
from an operand expression <TT>E1</TT> of type <TT>T1</TT>
to a target type related to the type <TT>T2</TT> of the
operand expression <TT>E2</TT> as follows:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>...</P></LI>

<LI><P>If <TT>E2</TT> is a prvalue or if neither of the
conversion sequences above can be formed and at least one of
the operands has (possibly cv-qualified) class
type:</P></LI>

<UL>
<LI><P>if <TT>T1</TT> and <TT>T2</TT> are the same class
type (ignoring cv-qualification) and <TT>T2</TT> is at least
as cv-qualified as <TT>T1</TT>, the target type is
<TT>T2</TT>,</P></LI>

<LI><P>otherwise, if <TT>T2</TT>
is a base class of <TT>T1</TT>, the target type is
<I>cv1</I> <TT>T2</TT>, where <I>cv1</I>
denotes the cv-qualifiers of <TT>T1</TT>,</P></LI>

<LI><P>otherwise, the target type is the type
that <TT>E2</TT> would have after applying the
lvalue-to-rvalue (7.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.lval">conv.lval</A>]),
array-to-pointer (7.3.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.array">conv.array</A>]), and
function-to-pointer (7.3.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.func">conv.func</A>]) standard
conversions.</P></LI>

</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It seems that to satisfy the conditions in the first two
sub-bullets, <TT>T2</TT> must be a class type, in which case
<TT>T2</TT> is the same as the type described in the third
sub-bullet, since the lvalue-to-rvalue conversion does not change
types and the other two conversions do not apply to a class
type. Thus, this bullet and sub-bullets could be simplified
to:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL><LI><P>if <TT>E2</TT> is a prvalue or if neither of the
conversion sequences above can be formed and at least one of
the operands has (possibly cv-qualified) class type, the target
type is the type that E2 would have after applying the
lvalue-to-rvalue (7.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.lval">conv.lval</A>]),
array-to-pointer (7.3.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.array">conv.array</A>]), and
function-to-pointer (7.3.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.func">conv.func</A>]) standard
conversions.</P></LI></UL>

<P><B>Notes from the August, 2020 teleconference:</B></P>

<P>This issue and suggested resolution predate the
resolution of <A HREF="2321.html">issue 2321</A>, which
added the second sub-bullet (the citation above reflects the
wording after adoption of <A HREF="2321.html">issue 2321</A>), giving the result the cv-qualification
of <TT>T1</TT> instead of that of <TT>T2</TT>.  The
suggested resolution would revert that accepted
resolution.</P>
