<P>[Accepted as a DR at the November, 2023 meeting.]</P>

<P>The description of how to handle file not ending in a newline in
5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.phases#1">lex.phases</A>] paragraph 1, phase 2, is:</P>

<OL START="2">
<LI><P>Each instance of a backslash character (<TT>\</TT>)
immediately followed by a new-line character is deleted, splicing physical
source lines to form logical source lines. Only the last backslash on any
physical source line shall be eligible for being part of such a splice. If,
as a result, a character sequence that matches the syntax of a
universal-character-name is produced, the behavior is undefined. A source
file that is not empty and that does not end in a new-line character, or
that ends in a new-line character immediately preceded by a backslash
character before any such splicing takes place, shall be processed as if an
additional new-line character were appended to the file.</P></LI>

</OL>

<P>This is not clear regarding what happens if the last character in the
file is a backslash.  In such a case, presumably the result of adding the
newline should not be a line splice but rather a
backslash <I>preprocessing-token</I> (that will be diagnosed as an invalid
token in phase 7), but that should be spelled out.</P>
