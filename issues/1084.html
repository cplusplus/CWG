<P>11.4.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.ctor#12">class.copy.ctor</A>] paragraph 12 says that a defaulted move
constructor is defined as deleted if the class has a non-static data
member or direct or virtual base class with a type that does not have
a move constructor and is not trivially copyable.  This seems more
strict than is necessary; the subobject need not be trivially copyable,
it should be enough for the selected constructor not to throw.  In any
case, the wording should be phrased in terms of the function selected
by overload resolution rather than properties of the subobject type,
and similarly for move assignment.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (November, 2010):</B></P>

<P>The CWG felt that the current specification was consistent and
not overly problematic; users can add their own move constructor
if needed.</P>
