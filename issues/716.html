<P>[Voted into WP at July, 2009 meeting.]</P>

<P>Unions are no longer forbidden to have static data members; however,
much of the wording of 11.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.union">class.union</A>] (and possibly other
places in the Standard) is still written with that assumption and
refers only to &#8220;data members&#8221; when clearly non-static
data members are in view.  From paragraph 1, for example:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

In a union, at most one of the <B>data members</B> can be active
at any time... The size of a union is sufficient
to contain the largest of its <B>data members</B>...

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (March, 2009):</B></P>

<OL>
<LI><P>Change the footnote in 6.8.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.type.qualifier#1">basic.type.qualifier</A>] paragraph 1
as follows:</P></LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The same representation and alignment requirements are meant to imply
interchangeability as arguments to functions, return values from
functions, and <INS>non-static data</INS> members of unions.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI><P>Change 7.2.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lval#15.6">basic.lval</A>] bullet 15.6 as
follows:</P></LI>

<UL><LI>an aggregate or union type that includes one of the
aforementioned types among its <INS>elements or non-static data</INS>
members (including, recursively, <DEL>a</DEL> <INS>an element or non-static
data</INS> member of a subaggregate or contained union),</LI></UL>

<LI><P>Change 7.6.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.rel#2.5">expr.rel</A>] bullet 2.5 as
follows:</P></LI>

<UL><LI>If two pointers point to <INS>non-static</INS> data members of the
same union object, they compare equal (after conversion to
<TT>void*</TT>, if necessary)...</LI></UL>

<LI><P>Change 9.12.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.align#8">dcl.align</A>] paragraph 8 as follows:</P></LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

[<I>Note:</I> the alignment of a union type can be strengthened by
applying the alignment attribute to any <INS>non-static data</INS> member
of the union.  &#8212;<I>end note</I>]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI><P>Change 9.4.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.aggr#15">dcl.init.aggr</A>] paragraph 15 as follows:</P></LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

When a union is initialized with a brace-enclosed initializer, the
braces shall only contain an <I>initializer-clause</I> for the
first <INS>non-static data</INS> member of the union...

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI><P>Change 11.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.union#1">class.union</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P></LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

In a union, at most one of the <INS>non-static</INS> data members can be
active at any time, that is, the value of at most one of the
<INS>non-static</INS> data members can be stored in a union at any time.
[<I>Note:</I> one special guarantee is made in order to simplify the
use of unions: If a standard-layout union contains several
standard-layout structs that share a common initial sequence
(11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem">class.mem</A>]), and if an object of this standard-layout
union type contains one of the standard-layout structs, it is
permitted to inspect the common initial sequence of any of
standard-layout struct members; see 11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem">class.mem</A>]. &#8212;<I>end note</I>] The size of a union is sufficient
to contain the largest of its <INS>non-static</INS> data members.  Each
<INS>non-static</INS> data member is allocated as if it were the sole
member of a struct.  A union can have...
