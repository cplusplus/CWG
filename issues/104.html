<P>Questions regarding when a throw-expression temporary object is destroyed.</P>
<P>
Section 14.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/except.throw">except.throw</A>]

paragraph 4 describes when the temporary is destroyed when a handler is found.
But what if no handler is found:</P>
<PRE>
    struct A {
        A() { printf ("A() \n"); }
        A(const A&amp;) { printf ("A(const A&amp;)\n"); }
        ~A() { printf ("~A() \n"); }
    };

    void t() { exit(0); }

    int main() {
        std::set_terminate(t);
        throw A();
    }
</PRE>
Does <TT>A::~A()</TT> ever execute here?
(Or, in case two constructions are done,
are there two destructions done?)  Is it implementation-defined, analogously
to whether the stack is unwound before <TT>terminate()</TT> is called
(14.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/except.handle#9">except.handle</A>] paragraph 9)
?
<P>
Or what if an exception specification is violated?  There are several
different scenarios here:</P>
<PRE>
    int glob = 0; // or 1 or 2 or 3

    struct A {
        A() { printf ("A() \n"); }
        A(const A&amp;) { printf ("A(const A&amp;)\n"); }
        ~A() { printf ("~A() \n"); }
    };

    void u() {
        switch (glob) {
        case 0:  exit(0);
        case 1:  throw "ok";
        case 2:  throw 17;
        default: throw;
        }
    }

    void foo() throw(const char*, std::bad_exception) {
        throw A();
    }

    int main() {
        std::set_unexpected(u);
        try {
            foo();
        }
        catch (const char*) { printf("in handler 1\n"); }
        catch (std::bad_exception) { printf("in handler 2\n"); }
    }
</PRE>
The case where <TT>u()</TT> exits is presumably similar to the <TT>terminate()</TT> case.
But in the cases where the program goes on, <TT>A::~A()</TT> should be called
for the thrown object at some point.  But where does this happen?
The standard doesn't really say.  Since an exception is defined to
be "finished" when the <TT>unexpected()</TT> function exits, it seems to me that
is where <TT>A::~A()</TT> should be called &#8212; in this case, as the throws of
new (or what will become new) exceptions are made out of <TT>u()</TT>.
Does this make sense?

<P>
<B>Rationale (10/99):</B> Neither <TT>std::exit(int)</TT> nor
<TT>std::abort()</TT> destroys temporary objects, so the exception
temporary is not destroyed when no handler is found.  The original
exception object is destroyed when it is replaced by an
<TT>unexpected()</TT> handler.  The Standard is sufficiently clear
on these points.</P>
