<P>[Accepted as a DR at the November, 2023 meeting.]</P>

<P>Subclause 9.12.11 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.attr.noreturn#2">dcl.attr.noreturn</A>] paragraph 2 specifies:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If a function f is called where f was previously declared with the
<TT>noreturn</TT> attribute and f eventually returns, the behavior is
undefined.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Undefineed behavior is, in general, detected during constant
evaluation, thus requiring an implementation to actually support
the <TT>noreturn</TT> attribute, such as in the following example:</P>

<PRE>
  [[noreturn]] constexpr void f() {}
  constexpr int x = (f(), 0);
</PRE>

<P>It might be desirable to treat the <TT>assume</TT>
and <TT>noreturn</TT> attributes alike in that regard.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (approved by CWG 2023-07-14) [SUPERSEDED]:</B></P>

<P>Split into a separate paragraph and change 7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.const#5">expr.const</A>] paragraph 5 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

It is unspecified whether E is a core constant expression if E
satisfies the constraints of a core constant expression, but
evaluation of E would evaluate
<UL>
<LI>an operation that has undefined
behavior as specified in Clause 16 through Clause 33,</LI>
<LI>an invocation of the va_start macro
(17.13.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/cstdarg.syn">cstdarg.syn</A>]), <DEL>or</DEL>
</LI>
<LI class="ins">a <TT>return</TT> statement in a function that was
previously declared with the <TT>noreturn</TT> attribute
(9.12.11 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.attr.noreturn">dcl.attr.noreturn</A>]), or</LI>
<LI>
a statement with an assumption (9.12.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.attr.assume">dcl.attr.assume</A>])
whose converted <I>conditional-expression</I>, if evaluated where the
assumption appears, would not disqualify E from being a core constant
expression and would not evaluate to <TT>true</TT>.  [ Note: .... ]</LI>
</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>CWG 2023-07-14</B></P>

<P>As an alternative, all of 9.12 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.attr">dcl.attr</A>] could be added
to the "library undefined behavior" bullet.  However, CWG felt that a
case-by-case consideration is warranted, given that assumptions set
precedent in requiring special treatment.</P>
