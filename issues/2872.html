<P>[Accepted as a DR at the June, 2024 meeting.]</P>



<P>It is unclear what "can be referred to" means in
6.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.link#2">basic.link</A>] paragraph 2.  Paragraph 8 provides precise
definitions for "same entity".</P>

<P><U>Possible resolution [SUPERSEDED]:</U></P>

<OL>
<LI>
<P>Replace in 6.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.link#2">basic.link</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE class="del">

A name is said to have <I>linkage</I> when it can denote the same object,
reference, function, type, template, namespace or value as a name
introduced by a declaration in another scope:

<UL>
<LI>When a name has external linkage, the entity it denotes can be
referred to by names from scopes of other translation units or from
other scopes of the same translation unit.</LI>
<LI>When a name has module linkage, the entity it denotes can be
referred to by names from other scopes of the same module unit
(10.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/module.unit">module.unit</A>]) or from scopes of other module units of
that same module.</LI>
<LI>When a
name has internal linkage, the entity it denotes can be referred to by
names from other scopes in the same translation unit.</LI>
<LI>When a name has no linkage, the entity it denotes cannot be
referred to by names from other scopes.</LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE class="ins">

A name can have <I>external linkage</I>, <I>module linkage</I>,
<I>internal linkage</I>, or <I>no linkage</I>, as determined by the
rules below.  [ Note: The linkage of a name determines when
corresponding declarations (6.4.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.scope.scope">basic.scope.scope</A>]) that introduce
that name can declare the same entity. ---end note]

</LI>

<LI>
<P>Change in 11.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.local#3">class.local</A>] paragraph 3 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<DEL>If class X is a local class, a nested class Y may be
declared in class X and later defined in the
definition of class X or be later defined in the same scope as the
definition of class X.</DEL> A class nested within a local class is a local
class.
<INS>A member of a local class X shall be declared only in the
definition of X or the nearest enclosing block scope of X.</INS>

<P>CWG opined to split off the second change (see
