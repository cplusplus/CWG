<P>It is not specified under what conditions an object pointer created
by converting a function pointer, as described in 7.6.1.10 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.reinterpret.cast#8">expr.reinterpret.cast</A>] paragraph 8, will be safely-derived, particularly in
light of the conditionally-supported, implementation-defined nature of
such conversions.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the March, 2009 meeting:</B></P>

<P>If this is to be addressed, the result should not be as suggested,
i.e., a requirement for implementation documentation appearing only in a
note.  At the least, such a requirement must be in normative text.</P>



<P><B>Rationale (July, 2009):</B></P>

<P>The definition of &#8220;safely-derived pointer&#8221; is clearly and
exclusively formulated in terms of pointers to objects. So no
implementation is required to maintain safe pointer derivation through
conversion to and from a function-pointer type.</P>

<P>On the other hand, any garbage-collecting implementation is free to
treat function pointers the same as object pointers for purposes of
collection. This would provide the effect of safe pointer derivation
through function-pointer types. An implementation is even free to
document this behavior, if it so chooses.</P>

<P>However, converting a pointer to a dynamically-allocated object
into a function pointer would be a very strange and almost always
pointless and unsafe thing to do. There is no need for the standard to
encourage this sort of behavior, even to the extent of adding a note
mentioning the possibility.</P>
