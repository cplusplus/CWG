Const template specializations and reference arguments

<P>Consider the following:</P>
<PRE>
	template &lt;typename T&gt; struct X {};  // #1
	template &lt;typename T&gt; struct X&lt;const T&gt;; //#2
	template struct X&lt;int&amp;&gt;; //#3
</PRE>

<P>Which specialization are we instantiating in #3?  The "obvious" answer
is #1, because "int&amp;" doesn't have a top level cv-qualification.
However, there's also an argument saying that we should actually be
instantiating #2.  The argument is: int&amp; can be taken as a match for
either one (top-level cv-qualifiers are ignored on references, so
they're equally good), and given two equally good matches we must
choose the more specialized one.</P>

<P>Is this a valid argument?  If so, is this behavior intentional?</P>

<P>
<U>John Spicer:</U>
I don't see the rationale for any choice other than #1.  While it is
true that if you attempt to apply const to a reference type it just
gets dropped, that is very different from saying that a reference type
is acceptable where a const-qualified type is required.</P>

<P>
<I>If</I> the type matched both templates, the const one would be
more specialized, but "int&amp;" does not match "const T".</P>

<P>
<U>Nathan Sidwell:</U>
thanks for bringing this one to the committee.  However this is
resolved, I'd like clarification on the followup questions in the
gcc bug report regarding deduced and non-deduced contexts and
function templates.  Here're those questions for y'all,</P>
<PRE>
template &lt;typename T&gt; void Foo (T *); // #1
template &lt;typename T&gt; void Foo (T const *); // #2
void Baz ();
Foo (Baz); // which?

template &lt;typename T&gt; T const *Foo (T *); // #1
void Baz ();
Foo (Baz); // well formed?

template &lt;typename T&gt; void Foo (T *, T const * = 0);
void Baz ();
Foo (Baz); // well formed?
</PRE>
<P>BTW, I didn't go trying to break things, I implemented the cv-qualifier
ignoring requirements and fell over this.  I could find nothing in the
standard saying 'don't do this ignoring during deduction'.</P>
