<P>[Moved to DR status at the April, 2013 meeting as paper N3667.]</P>



<P>Paragraphs 11 and 23 of 11.4.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.ctor">class.copy.ctor</A>] make a
defaulted move constructor and assignment operator, respectively,
deleted if there is a subobject with no corresponding move
function and for which the copy operation is non-trivial.  This
seems excessive and unnecessary.  For example:</P>

<PRE>
    template&lt;typename T&gt;
     struct wrap
     {
      wrap() = default;

    #ifdef USE_DEFAULTED_MOVE
      wrap(wrap&amp;&amp;) = default;
    #else
      wrap(wrap&amp;&amp; w) : t(static_cast&lt;T&amp;&amp;&gt;(w.t)) { }
    #endif

      wrap(const wrap&amp;) = default;

      T t;
     };

    struct S {
      S(){}
      S(const S&amp;){}
      S(S&amp;&amp;){}
    };

    typedef wrap&lt;const S&gt; W;

    W get() { return W(); }  //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> Error, if </SPAN>USE_DEFAULTED_MOVE<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> is defined, else OK</SPAN>
</PRE>

<P>In this example the defaulted move constructor of
<TT>wrap</TT> is selected by overload resolution, but this
move-constructor is deleted, because <TT>S</TT> has no
<I>trivial</I> copy-constructor.</P>

<P>I think that we overshoot here with the delete rules: I see no
problem for the defaulted move-constructor in this example. Our
triviality-deduction rules already cover this case (11.4.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.ctor#12">class.copy.ctor</A>] paragraph 12: <TT>W::W(W&amp;&amp;)</TT> is not
trivial) and our exception-specification rules (14.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/except.spec#14">except.spec</A>] paragraph 14) already correctly deduce a
<TT>noexcept(false)</TT> specification for
<TT>W::W(W&amp;&amp;)</TT>.</P>

<P>It would still be OK to prevent that a move-constructor
would be generated for the following example where no
user-declared defaulted copy/move members are present:</P>

<PRE>
    template&lt;typename T&gt;
     struct wrap_2
     {
      wrap_2() = default;
      T t;
     };

    typedef wrap_2&lt;const S&gt; W2;

    W2 get() { return W2(); }  //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> OK, selects copy constructor</SPAN>
</PRE>

<P>if we want. This would mean that we add a new bullet
to 11.4.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.ctor#9">class.copy.ctor</A>] paragraph 9 and paragraph 20.</P>

<P><B>Additional notes (August, 2012):</B></P>

<P>The proposed resolution was extensively discussed  and additional alternatives were
suggested.  A paper is being produced  for the October, 2012 meeting describing
the various options, so the issue has been returned to "review" status
to wait for the outcome of that deliberation.</P>

<P>See also the discussion of <A HREF="1491.html">issue 1491</A> for
additional considerations.</P>
