<P>[Voted into WP at April 2005 meeting.]</P>

<P>I've encountered a C++ program in which a member function wants to
declare that it may throw an object of its own class, e.g.:</P>
<PRE>
  class Foo {
  private:
     int val;
  public:
     Foo( int &amp;initval ) { val = initval; };
     void throwit() throw(Foo) { throw (*this); };
  };
</PRE>
<P>The compiler is complaining that Foo is an incomplete type, and can't be
used in the exception specification.</P>

<P>My reading of the standard [basic.types] is inconclusive.  Although it
does state that the class declaration is considered complete when the
closing brace is read, I believe it also intends that the member
function declarations should not be semantically validated until the
class has been completely declared.</P>

<P>If this isn't allowed, I don't know how else a member function could be
declared to throw an object of its own class.</P>

<P>
<U>John Spicer</U>:
The type is considered complete within function bodies, but not in their
declaration (see 11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem#2">class.mem</A>] paragraph 2).</P>

<P><B>Proposed Resolution:</B></P>

<P>Change 11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem#2">class.mem</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Within the class <I>member-specification</I>, the class is regarded
as complete within function bodies, default arguments<B>,
<I>exception-specification</I>s,</B> and constructor
<I>ctor-initializer</I>s (including such things in nested classes).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>Rationale:</B> Taken with 9.3.4.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct#6">dcl.fct</A>] paragraph 6, the
<I>exception-specification</I> is the <I>only</I> part of a function
declaration/definition in which the class name cannot be used because
of its putative incompleteness.  There is no justification for
singling out exception specifications this way; both in the function
body and in a <TT>catch</TT> clause, the class type will be complete,
so there is no harm in allowing the class name to be used in the
<I>exception-specification</I>.
</P>
