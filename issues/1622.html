<P>[Adopted at the February/March, 2017 meeting.]</P>

<P>According to 9.4.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.aggr#15">dcl.init.aggr</A>] paragraph 15,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

When a union is initialized with a brace-enclosed initializer, the braces
shall only contain an <I>initializer-clause</I> for the first non-static
data member of the union.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This would appear to preclude using <TT>{}</TT> as the initializer for a
union, which would otherwise have reasonable semantics.  Is there a reason
for this restriction?</P>

<P>Also, paragraph 7 reads,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If there are fewer <I>initializer-clause</I>s in the list than there are
members in the aggregate, then each member not explicitly initialized shall
be initialized from an empty initializer list (9.4.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.list">dcl.init.list</A>]).

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>There should presumably be special treatment for unions, so that only
a single member is initialized in such cases.</P>

<P>(See also <A HREF="1460.html">issue 1460</A>.)</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (November, 2016) [SUPERSEDED]:</B></P>

<P>Change 9.4.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.aggr#8">dcl.init.aggr</A>] paragraph 8 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<DEL>If there are fewer <I>initializer-clause</I>s in the list than there are
elements in the aggregate, then each</DEL> <INS>Each non-variant</INS>
element <INS>of the aggregate that is</INS>
not explicitly initialized
<DEL>shall be</DEL> <INS>is</INS>
initialized from its default member initializer
(11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem">class.mem</A>]) or, if there is no default member initializer,
<INS>copy-initialized</INS>
from an empty initializer list
(9.4.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.list">dcl.init.list</A>]). <INS>If the aggregate is a union
and the initializer list is empty, then</INS>
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P><INS>if any union member has a default member initilizer, that
member is initialized from its default member initializer;</INS></P></LI>

<LI><P><INS>otherwise, the first member of the union (if any) is
copy-initialized from an empty initializer list.</INS></P></LI>

</UL>

<P>[<I>Example:</I>...</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (February, 2017):</B></P>

<P>The resolution of <A HREF="2272.html">issue 2272</A> also resolves
this issue.</P>
