<P>[Moved to DR at the February, 2014 meeting.]</P>

<P>According to 6.5.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lookup.argdep#2">basic.lookup.argdep</A>] paragraph 2,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If <TT>T</TT> is a class type (including unions), its associated classes
are: the class itself; the class of which it is a member, if any; and its
direct and indirect base classes. Its associated namespaces are the
namespaces of which its associated classes are members.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Consider an example like</P>

<PRE>
  struct A {
    struct B {
      struct C { };
    };
  };
</PRE>

<P>
<TT>A</TT> has one associated class, itself, and has the global
namespace as its associated namespace.  <TT>A::B</TT> has two associated
classes, <TT>A</TT> and itself, and by virtue of its association with
<TT>A</TT>, has the global namespace as its associated namespace.
<TT>A::B::C</TT> has two associated classes, <TT>A::B</TT> and itself.
However, because neither <TT>A::B</TT> nor <TT>A::B::C</TT> is a
member of a namespace, <TT>A::B::C</TT> has no associated namespaces.</P>

<P>This seems like a defect.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (September, 2013):</B></P>

<P>This issue is resolved by the resolution of
<A HREF="1691.html">issue 1691</A>.</P>
