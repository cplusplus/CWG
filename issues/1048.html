<P>[Moved to DR at the April, 2013 meeting as part of paper N3638.]</P>



<P>
<TT>auto</TT> and lambda return types use slightly different rules
for determining the result type from an expression.  <TT>auto</TT>
uses the rules in 13.10.3.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.deduct.call">temp.deduct.call</A>], which explicitly drops
top-level cv-qualification in all cases, while the lambda return type
is based on the lvalue-to-rvalue conversion, which drops cv-qualification
only for non-class types.  As a result:</P>

<PRE>
    struct A { };

    const A f();

    auto a = f();               // decltype(a) is A
    auto b = []{ return f(); }; // decltype(b()) is const A
</PRE>

<P>This seems like an unnecessary inconsistency.</P>

<P>
<U>John Spicer</U>:</P>

<P>The difference is intentional; <TT>auto</TT> is intended only
to give a <TT>const</TT> type if you explicitly ask for it, while
the lambda return type should generally be the type of the
expression.</P>

<P>
<U>Daniel Kr&#252;gler</U>:</P>

<P>Another inconsistency: with <TT>auto</TT>, use of a
<I>braced-init-list</I> can deduce a specialization of
<TT>std::initializer_list</TT>; it would be helpful if the same
could be done for a lambda return type.</P>

<P><B>Additional note, February, 2014:</B></P>

<P>EWG noted that g++ and clang differ in their treatment of this
example and referred it back to CWG for resolution.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution, November, 2014:</B></P>

<P>This issue was actually resolved by paper N3638, adopted at the
April, 2013 meeting.  It is returned to "review" status to allow
consideration of whether the resolution should be considered a
change for C++14 or a retroactive change to C++11.
</P>

<P><B>Notes from the November, 2014 meeting:</B></P>

<P>CWG agreed that the change embodied in paper N3638 should be
considered to have been a DR against C++11.</P>
