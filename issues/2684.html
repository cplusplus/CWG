<P>Subclause 6.9.3.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.start.dynamic#7">basic.start.dynamic</A>] paragraph 7 specifies:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

It is implementation-defined whether the dynamic initialization of a
non-block non-inline variable with thread storage duration is
sequenced before the first statement of the initial function of a
thread or is deferred. If it is deferred, the initialization
associated with the entity for thread t is sequenced before the first
non-initialization odr-use by t of any non-inline variable with thread
storage duration defined in the same translation unit as the variable
to be initialized. ...

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>How does the rule quoted above affect variables
declared <TT>constinit</TT>?  For example:</P>

<PRE>
  extern thread_local constinit int x;
</PRE>

<P>Clang and gcc do not emit suitable wrapper code to allow for
deferred initialization of <TT>x</TT>, which is non-conforming.
Should this be allowed?</P>

<P><U>Suggested resolution:</U></P>

<P>Change in 6.9.3.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.start.dynamic#7">basic.start.dynamic</A>] paragraph 7 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

It is implementation-defined whether the dynamic initialization of a

thread or is deferred. If it is deferred, the initialization
associated with the entity for thread t is sequenced before the first
non-initialization odr-use by t of any non-inline variable with thread
storage duration <INS>and dynamic initialization</INS> defined in the
same translation unit as the variable to be initialized. ...
