<P>
<A HREF="2256.html">Issue 2256</A> (adopted in February, 2019)
changed the rules such that the lifetimes of objects do not depend on
whether the destructor is trivial or not.  However, the motivation of
that issue mentioned only objects with automatic storage duration.  To
be able to avoid order-of-destruction issues across translation units,
it would be useful to never end the lifetime of trivially-destructible
objects with static storage duration and to delay the end of the
lifetime of such objects with thread storage duration as long as
possible.</P>

<P>Change in 6.9.3.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.start.term#1">basic.start.term</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Constructed <INS>class</INS> objects (9.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init">dcl.init</A>]) with
static storage duration <INS>and having a non-trivial destructor
(11.4.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.dtor">class.dtor</A>])</INS> are destroyed and functions
registered with std::atexit are called as part of a call to std::exit
(17.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/support.start.term">support.start.term</A>]). The call to std::exit is sequenced before
the destructions and the registered functions.

<P>Change in 6.9.3.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.start.term#2">basic.start.term</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Constructed <INS>class</INS> objects with thread storage duration
within a given thread <INS>and having a non-trivial destructor
(11.4.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.dtor">class.dtor</A>])</INS> are destroyed as a result of
returning from the initial function of that thread and as a result of
that thread calling std::exit. The destruction
of <DEL>all</DEL> <INS>those</INS> constructed objects with thread
storage duration within that thread strongly happens before
<INS>releasing the storage for objects with thread storage duration
within that thread, which in turn strongly happens before</INS>
destroying any object with static storage duration.

<P><B>CWG 2024-09-27</B></P>

<P>Also allow for constant destruction, consider arrays of class type,
and adjust the happens-before requirements.</P>

<P>Continue to actually destroy constant-destruction objects, but do
so after all dynamic destruction is done.</P>
