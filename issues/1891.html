<P>[Moved to DR at the November, 2014 meeting.]</P>



<P>According to 7.5.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.prim.lambda#20">expr.prim.lambda</A>] paragraph 20,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The closure type associated with a <I>lambda-expression</I> has a deleted
(9.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct.def.delete">dcl.fct.def.delete</A>]) default constructor and a deleted copy
assignment operator. It has an implicitly-declared copy constructor
(11.4.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.ctor">class.copy.ctor</A>]) and may have an implicitly-declared move
constructor (11.4.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.ctor">class.copy.ctor</A>]).

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>However, according to 11.4.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.ctor#9">class.copy.ctor</A>] paragraph 9,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If the definition of a class <TT>X</TT> does not explicitly declare a move
constructor, one will be implicitly declared as defaulted if and only if</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>
<TT>X</TT> does not have a user-declared copy
constructor,</P></LI>

<LI><P>
<TT>X</TT> does not have a user-declared copy assignment
operator,</P></LI>

<LI><P>
<TT>X</TT> does not have a user-declared move assignment operator,
and</P></LI>

<LI><P>
<TT>X</TT> does not have a user-declared destructor.</P></LI>

</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It is not clear how this applies to the closure class.  Would it be
better to state that the closure class has a defaulted move constructor
and a defaulted move assignment operator?  There is already wording that
handles the case if they are ultimately defined as deleted.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (October, 2014):</B></P>

<P>Change 7.5.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.prim.lambda#20">expr.prim.lambda</A>] paragraph 20 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The closure type associated with a <I>lambda-expression</I>
has <DEL>a deleted
(9.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.fct.def.delete">dcl.fct.def.delete</A>])</DEL> <INS>no</INS> default
constructor and a deleted copy assignment operator. It has
<DEL>an implicitly-declared</DEL> <INS>a defaulted</INS> copy constructor
<DEL>(11.4.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.ctor">class.copy.ctor</A>]) and may have an
implicitly-declared</DEL> <INS>and a defaulted</INS> move
constructor (11.4.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.ctor">class.copy.ctor</A>]). [<I>Note:</I> <DEL>The
copy/move constructor is implicitly defined in the same way
as any other implicitly declared copy/move constructor would
be implicitly defined</DEL> <INS>These special member functions are
implicitly defined as usual, and might therefore be defined as
deleted</INS>. &#8212;<I>end note</I>]
