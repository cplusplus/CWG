Late ambiguity for partial template specialization

<P>If a partial specialization is introduced later than where it would
have been used, the program is ill-formed, no diagnostic required.
The same should apply if the late declaration would have caused an
ambiguity.</P>

<P>Also consider removing the redundancy between
13.4.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.arg.template#2">temp.arg.template</A>] paragraph 2 and 13.7.6.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.spec.partial.general#1">temp.spec.partial.general</A>] paragraph 1 for that matter.</P>

<P><U>Possible resolution:</U></P>

<P>Change in 13.4.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.arg.template#2">temp.arg.template</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Any partial specializations (13.7.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.spec.partial">temp.spec.partial</A>]) associated
with the primary template are considered when a specialization based
on the template <I>template-parameter</I> is instantiated. <DEL>If a
specialization is not reachable from the point of instantiation, and
it would have been selected had it been reachable, the program is
ill-formed, no diagnostic required.</DEL>
<INS>[ Note: A partial specialization cannot be introduced after its
first potential use (13.7.6.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.spec.partial.general">temp.spec.partial.general</A>]). -- end note
] </INS>

<P>Change in 13.7.6.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.spec.partial.general#1">temp.spec.partial.general</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A partial specialization of a template provides an alternative
definition of the template that is used instead of the primary
definition when the arguments in a specialization match those given in
the partial specialization (13.7.6.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.spec.partial.match">temp.spec.partial.match</A>]). A
declaration of the primary template shall precede any partial
specialization of that template. A partial specialization shall be
reachable from any <DEL>use of a template specialization that would
make use of the partial specialization as the result of an implicit or
explicit</DEL> <INS>point of</INS> instantiation <INS>where that
partial specialization would have been selected or would have
contributed to ambiguity</INS>; no diagnostic is required.
