<P>[Accepted as a DR at the February, 2019 meeting.]</P>

<P>According to 7.5.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.prim.id.qual#5">expr.prim.id.qual</A>] paragraph 5,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

In a <I>qualified-id</I>, if the <I>unqualified-id</I> is
a <I>conversion-function-id</I>, its <I>conversion-type-id</I> shall denote
the same type in both the context in which the entire <I>qualified-id</I>
occurs and in the context of the class denoted by
the <I>nested-name-specifier</I>.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>However, _N4868_.6.5.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lookup.classref#7">basic.lookup.classref</A>] paragraph 7 says,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If the <I>id-expression</I> is a <I>conversion-function-id</I>,
its <I>conversion-type-id</I> is first looked up in the class of the object
expression and the name, if found, is used. Otherwise it is looked up in
the context of the entire <I>postfix-expression</I>. In each of these
lookups, only names that denote types or templates whose specializations
are types are considered.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The latter was changed by <A HREF="1111.html">issue 1111</A>. It
seems the former may have been overlooked in that change.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (February, 2019):</B></P>

<P>Change 7.5.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.prim.id.qual#4">expr.prim.id.qual</A>] paragraph 4 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

In a <I>qualified-id</I>, if the <I>unqualified-id</I> is
a <I>conversion-function-id</I>,
its <I>conversion-type-id</I> <DEL>shall denote the same type in
both the context in which the entire <I>qualified-id</I>
occurs and in the context of the class denoted by
the <I>nested-name-specifier</I></DEL>
<INS>is first looked up in the class denoted by the
<I>nested-name-specifier</I> of the <I>qualified-id</I> and
the name, if found, is used. Otherwise, it is looked up
in the context in which the entire <I>qualified-id</I>
occurs. In each of these lookups, only names that denote types
or templates whose specializations are types are considered</INS>.
