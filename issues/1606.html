<P>The standard forbids a lambda from appearing in a <TT>sizeof</TT>
operand:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A <I>lambda-expression</I> shall not appear in an unevaluated operand
(Clause 7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr">expr</A>]).

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>(7.5.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.prim.lambda#2">expr.prim.lambda</A>] paragraph 2).  However, there appears to be
no prohibition of the equivalent usage when a variable or data member has a
closure class as its type:</P>

<PRE>
  int main() {
    int i = 1;
    int j = 1;
    auto f = [=]{ return i + j;};
    return sizeof(f);
  }
</PRE>

<P>According to 7.5.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.prim.lambda#3">expr.prim.lambda</A>] paragraph 3, the size
of a closure class is not specified, so that it could vary between
translation units or between otherwise link-compatible implementations,
which could result in ODR violations if the size is used as a template
non-type argument, for example.  Should the Standard forbid taking the
size of a closure class?  Or should this simply be left as an ABI issue,
as is done with other size and alignment questions?</P>

<P><B>Additional note, April, 2013:</B></P>

<P>It was observed that generic function wrappers like
<TT>std::function</TT> rely on the ability to make compile-time
decisions based on the size of the function object, and forbidding
the application of <TT>sizeof</TT> to closure classes would make
that unnecessarily difficult.  </P>

<P><B>Rationale (April, 2013):</B></P>

<P>CWG agreed that the ODR and portability considerations were not
sufficient to outweigh the utility of applying <TT>sizeof</TT> to
closure classes as mentioned in the April, 2013 note and that the
issues are more appropriately dealt with in an ABI specification.</P>
