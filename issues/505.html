<P>[Voted into WP at the October, 2006 meeting.]</P>

<P>The current wording of 5.13.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.ccon#3">lex.ccon</A>] paragraph 3
states,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If the character following a backslash is not one of those specified,
the behavior is undefined.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Paper J16/04-0167=WG21 N1727 suggests that such character escapes
be ill-formed.  In discussions at the Lillehammer meeting, however,
the CWG felt that the newly-approved category of
conditionally-supported behavior would be more appropriate.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (April, 2006):</B></P>

<P>Change the next-to-last sentence of 5.13.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex.ccon#3">lex.ccon</A>] paragraph 3
from:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If the character following a backslash is not one of those specified,
the behavior is undefined.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>to:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Escape sequences in which the character following the backslash is not
listed in Table 6 are conditionally-supported, with
implementation-defined semantics.
