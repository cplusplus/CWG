<P>[Moved to DR at the April, 2013 meeting.]</P>



<P>One of the criteria in 6.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.def.odr#6">basic.def.odr</A>] paragraph 6 for
when a entity is allowed to have multiple definitions is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

in each definition of <TT>D</TT>, corresponding names, looked up
according to 6.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lookup">basic.lookup</A>], shall refer to an entity
defined within the definition of <TT>D</TT>, or shall refer to the
same entity, after overload resolution (12.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.match">over.match</A>]) and
after matching of partial template specialization (13.10.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.over">temp.over</A>]), except that a name can refer to a <TT>const</TT>
object with internal or no linkage if the object has the same literal
type in all definitions of <TT>D</TT>, and the object is initialized
with a constant expression (7.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.const">expr.const</A>]), and the value
(but not the address) of the object is used, and the object has the
same value in all definitions of <TT>D</TT>; and

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This wording is possibly not sufficiently clear for an example like:</P>

<PRE>
  const volatile int n = 0;
  inline int get() { return n; }
</PRE>

<P>Presumably this code could not appear in multiple translation units,
because the requirement that <TT>n</TT> &#8220;has the same value in
all definitions&#8221; cannot be satisfied (the value of a volatile
variable can change &#8220;by means undetectable by the
implementation,&#8221; per 9.2.9.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.type.cv#7">dcl.type.cv</A>] paragraph 7,
so the value of <TT>n</TT> might be different in each translation
unit).  However, it might be good to make it explicit that &#8220;a
<TT>const</TT> object&#8221; is not intended to apply to a
volatile-qualified object.</P>

<P>Other points that were raised during the discussion of this issue
were that it would probably be better to rephrase &#8220;the value
(but not the address) of the object is used&#8221; in terms of the
odr-use of the object, as well as questioning why a <TT>const
volatile</TT> variable implicitly has internal linkage.</P>
