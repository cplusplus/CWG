<P>[Accepted as a DR at the February, 2019 meeting.]</P>



<P>The aliasing rules of 7.2.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lval#10">basic.lval</A>] paragraph 10 were
adapted from C with additions for C++.  However, a number of the points
either do not apply or are subsumed by other points.  For example, the
provision for aggregate and union types is needed in C for struct
assignment, which in C++ is done via constructors and assignment
operators in C++, not by accessing the complete object.</P>

<P><U>Suggested resolution:</U></P>

<P>Replace 7.2.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lval#10">basic.lval</A>] paragraph 10 as follows:</P>

<P>If a program attempts to access the stored value of an object
through a glvalue whose type is not similar (7.3.6 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.qual">conv.qual</A>])
to one of the following types the behavior is undefined:
[<I>Footnote:</I>... &#8212;<I>end footnote</I>]</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>the dynamic type of the object,</P></LI>

<LI><P>the signed or unsigned type corresponding to the dynamic
type of the object, or</P></LI>

<LI><P>a <TT>char</TT> or <TT>unsigned char</TT> type.</P></LI>

</UL>

<P><B>Additional note, October, 2015:</B></P>

<P>It has been suggested 
that the aliasing rules should be extended to permit an object of
an enumeration with a fixed underlying type to alias an object with
that underlying type.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (January, 2019):</B></P>

<LI><P>Change 7.2.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lval#11">basic.lval</A>] paragraph 11 as follows:</P></LI>
