<P>[Moved to DR at the February, 2014 meeting.]</P>

<P>According to 6.5.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lookup.argdep#2">basic.lookup.argdep</A>] paragraph 2,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If <TT>T</TT> is an enumeration type, its associated namespace is the
namespace in which it is defined. If it is class member, its associated
class is the member's class; else it has no associated class.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This does not take into account opaque enumerations, which can be
defined in an enclosing namespace of the one of which is a member.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (September, 2013):</B></P>

<P>Change 6.5.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.lookup.argdep#2">basic.lookup.argdep</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>...The sets of namespaces and classes are determined in the following
way:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>...</P></LI>

<LI><P>If <TT>T</TT> is a class type (including unions), its associated
classes are: the class itself; the class of which it is a member, if any;
and its direct and indirect base classes. Its associated namespaces are the
<INS>innermost enclosing</INS> namespaces of <DEL>which</DEL> its
associated classes <DEL>are members</DEL>. Furthermore..</P></LI>

<LI><P>If <TT>T</TT> is an enumeration type, its associated namespace is
the <INS>innermost enclosing</INS> namespace <DEL>in which it is
defined</DEL> <INS>of its declaration</INS>. If it is <INS>a</INS> class
member, its associated class is the member's class; else it has no
associated class.</P></LI>

<LI><P>...</P></LI>

</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This resolution also resolves issues <A HREF="1690.html">1690</A>
and <A HREF="1692.html">1692</A>.</P>
