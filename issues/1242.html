<P>[Voted into the WP at the March, 2011 meeting as part of paper N3262.]</P>



<P>The current wording of 11.9.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.base.init#5">class.base.init</A>] paragraph 5 says,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A <I>ctor-initializer</I> may initialize the member of an anonymous union
that is a member of the constructor's class.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The wording &#8220;the member&#8221; is strange; furthermore, this
should be restricted to non-static data members.  That could be
accomplished by using the existing term &#8220;variant members,&#8221;
which is defined in 11.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.union#8">class.union</A>] paragraph 8 to be
&#8220;the non-static data members of all anonymous unions that are
members of&#8221; the class (which by definition must be non-static
data members, since a storage class specifier is not allowed on an
anonymous union in class scope).</P>
