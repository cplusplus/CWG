Unclear wording in disambiguation section </H4>

<P>Consider the following program:</P>
<PRE>
  struct Point
  {
    Point(int){}
  };
  struct Lattice
  {
    Lattice(Point, Point, int){}
  };
  int main(void)
  {
    int a, b;
    Lattice latt(Point(a), Point(b), 3);   /* Line X */
  }
</PRE>

<P>The problem concerns the line marked <TT>/* Line X */</TT>, which is an
ambiguous declarations for either an object or a function.
The clause that governs this ambiguity is 9.3.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.ambig.res#1">dcl.ambig.res</A>] paragraph 1,
 and reads:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The ambiguity arising from the similarity between a function-style
cast and a declaration mentioned in 8.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/stmt.ambig">stmt.ambig</A>]
can also occur in the context
of a declaration. In that context, the choice is between a function
declaration with a redundant set of parentheses around a parameter
name and an object declaration with a function-style cast as the
initializer. Just as for the ambiguities mentioned in
8.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/stmt.ambig">stmt.ambig</A>], the
resolution is to consider any construct that could possibly be a
declaration a declaration. [Note: a declaration can be explicitly
disambiguated by a nonfunction-style cast, by a <TT>=</TT> to indicate
initialization or by removing the redundant parentheses around the
parameter name. ]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Based on this clause there are two possible interpretations of the
declaration in line X:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
The declaration of latt declares a function with a return value of
the type Lattice and taking three arguments. The type of the first two
arguments is Point and each of these arguments is followed by a
parameter name in redundant parentheses. The type of the third
argument can not be determined, because it is a literal.
This will result in a syntax error.
</LI>
<LI>
The declaration of latt declares an object, because the other option
(a function declaration) would result in a syntax error.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>Note that the last sentence before the "[Note:" is not much help,
because both options are declarations.</P>

<P><I>Steve Adamczyk: a number of people replied to this posting
on comp.std.c++ saying that they did not see a problem.  The
original poster replied:</I></P>

<P>I can't do anything but agree with your argumentation.
So there is only one correct interpretation of
9.3.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.ambig.res#1">dcl.ambig.res</A>] paragraph 1, but I
have to say that with some rewording, the clause can be made a lot
clearer, like stating explicitly that the entire declaration must be
taken into account and that function declarations are preferred over
object declarations.</P>

<P>I would like to suggest the following as replacement for the current
9.3.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.ambig.res#1">dcl.ambig.res</A>] paragraph 1:</P>

<P>The working group felt that the current wording is clear enough.</P>
