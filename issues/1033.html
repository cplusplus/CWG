<P>[Voted into the WP at the March, 2011 meeting as part of paper N3262.]</P>



<P>According to 9.12.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.align#5">dcl.align</A>] paragraph 5,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The combined effect of all alignment attributes in a declaration
shall not specify an alignment that is less strict than the
alignment that would otherwise be required for the entity being
declared.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&#8220;...would otherwise be required&#8221; could be read as
referring to the alignment set by another declaration of the
entity.  However, it was intended to prevent specifying an
alignment smaller than the natural alignment the entity would
have in the absence of an <TT>align</TT> attribute.  The wording
should be changed to make that clearer.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (February, 2011) [SUPERSEDED]:</B></P>

<P>Change 9.12.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.align#5">dcl.align</A>] paragraph 5 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The combined effect of all <I>alignment-specifier</I>s in a
declaration shall not specify an alignment that is less strict than
the alignment that would <DEL>otherwise</DEL> be required for the
entity being declared <INS>if all <I>alignment-specifier</I>s were
ignored (including those in other declarations)</INS>.
