<P>[Voted into the WP at the June, 2008 meeting as paper N2656.]</P>



<P>In the interest of promoting use of <TT>nullptr</TT> instead of the
integer literal 0 as the null pointer constant, the proposal accepted
by the Committee does not provide for converting a zero-valued integral
constant to type <TT>std::nullptr_t</TT>.  However, this omission reduces
the utility of the feature for use in the library for smart pointers.
In particular, the addition of that conversion (along with a converting
constructor accepting a <TT>std::nullptr_t</TT>) would allow smart
pointers to be used just like ordinary pointers in expressions like:</P>

<PRE>
    if (p == 0) { }
    if (0 == p) { }
    if (p != 0) { }
    if (0 != p) { }
    p = 0;
</PRE>

<P>The existing use of the &#8220;unspecified bool type&#8221; idiom
supports this usage, but being able to use <TT>std::nullptr_t</TT>
instead would be simpler and more elegant.</P>

<P>
<U>Jason Merrill</U>: I have another reason to support the
conversion as well: it seems to me very odd for <TT>nullptr_t</TT> to
be more restrictive than <TT>void*</TT>.  Anything we can do with an
arbitrary pointer, we ought to be able to do with <TT>nullptr_t</TT>
as well.  Specifically, since there is a standard conversion from
literal 0 to <TT>void*</TT>, and there is a standard conversion
from <TT>void*</TT> to <TT>bool</TT>, <TT>nullptr_t</TT> should
support the same conversions.
</P>

<P>This changes two of the example lines in the proposal as
adopted:</P>

<PRE>
    if (nullptr) ;      //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> error, no conversion to </SPAN>bool
    if (nullptr == 0) ; //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> error</SPAN>
</PRE>

<P>become</P>

<PRE>
    if (nullptr) ;      //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> evaluates to </SPAN>false
    if( nullptr == 0 ); //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> evaluates to </SPAN>true
</PRE>

<P>And later,</P>

<PRE>
    char* ch3 = expr ? nullptr : nullptr; //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> </SPAN>ch3<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> is the null pointer value</SPAN>
    char* ch4 = expr ? 0 : nullptr;       //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> </SPAN>ch4<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> is the null pointer value</SPAN>
    int n3 = expr ? nullptr : nullptr;    //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> error, </SPAN>nullptr_t<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> can't be converted to </SPAN>int
    int n4 = expr ? 0 : nullptr;          //<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> error, </SPAN>nullptr_t<SPAN CLASS="cmnt"> can't be converted to </SPAN>int
</PRE>

<P>I would also allow <TT>reinterpret_cast</TT>
from <TT>nullptr_t</TT> to integral type, with the same semantics as a
<TT>reinterpret_cast</TT> from the null pointer value to integral type.</P>

<P>Basically, I would like <TT>nullptr_t</TT> to act like
a <TT>void*</TT> which is constrained to always
be <TT>(void*)0</TT>.</P>
