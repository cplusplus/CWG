<P>[Voted into the WP at the July, 2007 meeting as part of paper
J16/07-0202 = WG21 N2342.]</P>



<P>It should be made clear in 11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem#15">class.mem</A>] paragraph 15,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Two POD-struct (Clause 11 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class">class</A>]) types are
layout-compatible if they have the same number of non-static data
members, and corresponding non-static data members (in order) have
layout-compatible types (6.8 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.types">basic.types</A>]).

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>that &#8220;corresponding... (in order)&#8221; refers to declaration
order and not the order in which the members are laid out in memory.</P>

<P>However, this raises the point that, in cases where an
<I>access-specifier</I> is involved, the declaration and layout
order can be different (see paragraph 12).  Thus, for two POD-struct
classes <TT>A</TT> and <TT>B</TT>,</P>

<PRE>
    struct A {
        char c;
        int i;
    }
    struct B {
        char c;
      public:
        int i;
    };
</PRE>

<P>a compiler could move <TT>B::i</TT> before <TT>B::c</TT>, but
<TT>A::c</TT> must precede <TT>A::i</TT>.  It does not seem
reasonable that these two POD-structs would be considered
layout-compatible, even though they satisfy the requirement that
corresponding members in declaration order are layout-compatible.</P>

<P>One possibility would be to require that neither POD-struct have
an <I>access-specifier</I> in order to be considered
layout-compatible.  (It's not sufficient to require that they have
the same <I>access-specifier</I>s, because the compiler is not
required to lay out the storage the same way for different classes.)</P>

<P>9.4.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.aggr#2">dcl.init.aggr</A>] paragraph 2 should also be clarified
to make explicit that &#8220;increasing... member order&#8221; refers
to declaration order.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (April, 2007):</B></P>

<P>This issue will be resolved by the adoption of the POD proposal
(currently J16/07-0090 = WG21 N2230).  That paper does not propose
a change to the wording of 9.4.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.aggr#2">dcl.init.aggr</A>] paragraph 2,
but the CWG feels that the intent of that paragraph (that the
initializers are used in declaration order) is clear enough not to
require revision.</P>
