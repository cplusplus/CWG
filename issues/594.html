<P>[Voted into the WP at the September, 2008 meeting.]</P>

<P>In ISO/IEC 14882:2003, the second bullet of 6.7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.life#1">basic.life</A>] paragraph 1 reads,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

if <TT>T</TT> is a class type with a non-trivial constructor
(11.4.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.ctor">class.ctor</A>]), the constructor call has completed.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<A HREF="119.html">Issue 119</A> pointed out that
aggregate initialization can be used with some classes with a
non-trivial implicitly-declared default constructor, and that
in such cases there is no call to the object's constructor.
The resolution for that issue was to change the previously-cited
wording to read,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If <TT>T</TT> is a class type with a non-trivial constructor
(11.4.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.ctor">class.ctor</A>], <INS>the initialization is complete</INS>.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Later (but before the WP was revised with the wording from
the resolution of <A HREF="119.html">issue 119</A>),
<A HREF="404.html">issue 404</A> changed the 2003 wording to
read,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If <TT>T</TT> is a class type <INS>and the constructor invoked to
create the object is non-trivial</INS> (11.4.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.ctor">class.ctor</A>]),
the constructor call has completed.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>thus reversing the effect of <A HREF="119.html">issue 119</A>,
whose whole purpose was to cover objects with non-trivial constructors
that are <I>not</I> invoked.</P>

<P>Through an editorial error, the post-Redmond draft (N1905)
still contained the original 2003 wording that should have been
replaced by the resolution of <A HREF="119.html">issue 119</A>, <I>in addition to</I> the new wording from the
resolution:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

if <TT>T</TT> is a class type and the constructor invoked to
create the object is non-trivial (11.4.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.ctor">class.ctor</A>]),
the constructor call has completed. the initialization is
complete.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Finally, during the application of the edits for delegating
constructors (N1986), this editing error was &#8220;fixed&#8221;
by retaining the original 2003 wording (which was needed for the
application of the change specified in N1986), so that the
current draft (N2009) reads,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

if <TT>T</TT> is a class type and the constructor invoked to
create the object is non-trivial (11.4.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.ctor">class.ctor</A>]),
the principal constructor call 11.9.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.base.init">class.base.init</A>]) has
completed.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Because the completion of the call to the principal constructor
corresponds to the point at which the object is &#8220;fully
constructed&#8221; (14.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/except.ctor#2">except.ctor</A>] paragraph 2), i.e.,
its initialization is complete, I believe that the exact wording
of the <A HREF="119.html">issue 119</A> resolution would be
correct and should be restored verbatim.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (June, 2008):</B></P>

<P>Change 6.7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.life#1">basic.life</A>] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The <I>lifetime</I> of an object is a runtime property of the
object. <INS>An object is said to have non-trivial initialization if it
is of a class or aggregate type and it or one of its members is
initialized by a constructor other than a trivial default
constructor. [<I>Note:</I> Initialization by a trivial copy
constructor is non-trivial initialization. &#8212;<I>end note</I>]</INS>
The lifetime of an object <DEL>of type <TT>T</TT></DEL> begins when:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>storage with the proper alignment and size <DEL>for type
<TT>T</TT></DEL> is obtained, and</P></LI>

<LI><P>if <DEL><TT>T</TT> is a class type and the constructor invoked to
create the object is non-trivial (11.4.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.ctor">class.ctor</A>]), the
principal constructor call (11.9.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.base.init">class.base.init</A>]) has
completed. [<I>Note:</I> the initialization can be performed by a
constructor call or, in the case of an aggregate with an
implicitly-declared non-trivial default constructor, an aggregate
initialization 9.4.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.aggr">dcl.init.aggr</A>]. &#8212;<I>end note</I>]</DEL>
<INS>the object has non-trivial initialization, its initialization is
complete.</INS>
</P></LI>

</UL>

<P>The lifetime of an object of type <TT>T</TT> ends when...</P>
