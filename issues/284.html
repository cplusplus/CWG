<P>[Moved to DR at October 2002 meeting.]</P>

<P>Although 9.3.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.meaning">dcl.meaning</A>] requires that a declaration of
a <I>qualified-id</I> refer to a member of the specified namespace or
class and that the member not have been introduced by a
<I>using-declaration</I>, it applies only to names declared in a
declarator.  It is not clear whether there is existing wording
enforcing the same restriction for <I>qualified-id</I>s in
<I>class-specifier</I>s and <I>elaborated-type-specifier</I>s or
whether additional wording is required.  Once such wording is
found/created, the proposed resolution of
<A HREF="275.html">issue 275</A> must be modified accordingly.</P>

<P><B>Notes from 10/01 meeting:</B></P>

<P>The sentiment was that this should be required on class definitions, but
not on elaborated type specifiers in general (which are references, not
declarations).  We should also make sure we consider explicit instantiations,
explicit specializations, and friend declarations.</P>


<P><B>Proposed resolution (10/01):</B></P>

<P>Add after the end of 11.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.name#3">class.name</A>] paragraph 3:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When a <I>nested-name-specifier</I> is specified in a
<I>class-head</I> or in an
<I>elaborated-type-specifier</I>, the resulting qualified name
shall refer to a previously declared member of the class or namespace to
which the <I>nested-name-specifier</I> refers, and
the member shall not have been introduced by a
using-declaration in the scope of the class or namespace
nominated by the <I>nested-name-specifier</I>.
