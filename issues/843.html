<P>Although the current wording does specify the outcome, it is not
immediately apparent what the result of an example like the following
should be:</P>

<PRE>
    template&lt;std::ObjectType T&gt;
    struct S {
        requires std::CopyConstructible&lt;T&gt;
        S(const S&amp;) = default;
    };
</PRE>

<P>The outcome (that <TT>S</TT> will have an implicitly-declared
copy constructor that is defined as deleted in specializations in
which <TT>T</TT> is not copy-constructible) would be clearer
with the addition of two notes.  First, it would be helpful if
13.7.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.class#5">temp.class</A>] paragraph 5, which currently reads,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A constrained member (11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem">class.mem</A>]) in a class template is
declared only in class template specializations in which its template
requirements (_N2914_.14.11.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.req">temp.req</A>]) are satisfied
(_N2914_.14.11.1.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.req.sat">temp.req.sat</A>])...

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>had a note or footnote to the effect,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

When a constrained member of a template is a special member function,
and when, in an instantiation, the member is not declared because its
requirements are not satisfied, the special member is considered not
to have been &#8220;explicitly declared&#8221; (i.e., the member is
not user-declared); therefore a declaration may still be implicitly
generated as specified in 11.4.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/special">special</A>].

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The fact that the implicitly-declared copy constructor in this
case is defined as deleted would be clearer if somewhere in
the second list in 11.4.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.ctor#5">class.copy.ctor</A>] paragraph 5, which
currently reads</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>...An implicitly-declared copy constructor for a class <TT>X</TT> is
defined as deleted if <TT>X</TT> has:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>a variant member with a non-trivial copy constructor and
<TT>X</TT> is a union-like class,</P></LI>

<LI><P>a non-static data member of class type <TT>M</TT> (or array
thereof) that cannot be copied because overload resolution
(12.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.match">over.match</A>]), as applied to <TT>M</TT>'s copy
constructor, results in an ambiguity or a function that is deleted or
inaccessible from the implicitly-declared copy constructor,
or</P></LI>

<LI><P>a direct or virtual base class <TT>B</TT> that cannot be copied
because overload resolution (12.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/over.match">over.match</A>]), as applied to
<TT>B</TT>'s copy constructor, results in an ambiguity or a function
that is deleted or inaccessible from the implicitly-declared copy
constructor.</P></LI>

</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>there were a cross-reference to _N2914_.14.11.2.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.archetype.assemble">temp.archetype.assemble</A>],
whose third paragraph reads,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If no requirement specifies a copy constructor for a type <TT>T</TT>,
a copy constructor is implicitly declared (11.4.5.3 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.copy.ctor">class.copy.ctor</A>])
in the archetype of <TT>T</TT> with the following signature:

<PRE>
    T(const T&amp;) = delete;
</PRE>
