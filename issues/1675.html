<P>9.3.4.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.array#1">dcl.array</A>] paragraph 1 says,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The expression is <I>erroneous</I> if:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>...</P></LI>

<LI><P>its value is such that the size of the allocated object would exceed
the implementation-defined limit (Annex Clause Annex B [<A href="https://wg21.link/implimits">implimits</A>]);</P></LI>

<LI><P>...</P></LI>

</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The only relevant limit in Clause Annex B [<A href="https://wg21.link/implimits">implimits</A>] is that
of the size of an object, but presumably an implementation might want
to impose a smaller limit on a stack-based object.  This separate
quantity is referred to in paragraph 4 when describing an array of
unspecified bound:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If the size of the array exceeds the size of the memory available for
objects with automatic storage duration, the behavior is undefined.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>but perhaps it needs to be mentioned in Clause Annex B [<A href="https://wg21.link/implimits">implimits</A>] as
well.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (September, 2013):</B></P>

<P>This issue is resolved by the resolution of
<A HREF="1761.html">issue 1761</A>.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (February, 2014):</B></P>

<P>The specification was removed from the WP and moved into a
Technical Specification.</P>

<P><B>Notes from the February, 2014 meeting:</B></P>

<P>CWG discussed adding such a limit, even without the changes for
arrays of runtime bound, but decided that it was unneeded; such
handling could be added by implementations if desirable.</P>
