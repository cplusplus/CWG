<P>The definition of a &#8220;narrowing conversion&#8221; in
9.4.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/dcl.init.list#7">dcl.init.list</A>] paragraph 7 is couched in terms of the
type of the target.  A conversion to a too-small bit-field should
presumably also be categorized as a narrowing conversion.  (See also
<A HREF="1449.html">issue 1449</A>.)</P>

<P><B>Additional note (August, 2012):</B></P>

<P>It was observed  that
the proposed narrowing error, unlike in other contexts, cannot be
circumvented by adding a cast.  The only way to avoid a narrowing
error would be to avoid using the brace syntax or to mask the value
to an appropriate width.  Even the latter approach could conceivably
require an implementation to track the maximum number of bits needed
by operations applied on top of the masked value, unless the masking
were required to be at the top level of the initializer expression.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (October, 2012):</B></P>

<P>CWG felt that this was more of a language design question and would
be better considered by EWG.</P>

<P><B>Rationale (February, 2014):</B></P>

<P>EWG determined that no action should be taken on this issue.</P>
