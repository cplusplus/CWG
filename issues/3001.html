Inconsistent restrictions for <TT>static_cast</TT> on pointers to out-of-lifetime objects

<P>According to 6.7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.life#7">basic.life</A>] paragraph 7, converting a pointer-to-derived to pointer-to-base for an out-of-lifetime object is allowed implicitly, but disallowed using <TT>static_cast</TT>.  That seems inconsistent.</P>

<P>Also, the out-of-lifetime rules mishandle this example:</P>

<PRE>
  int a;
  int *p = &amp;a;
  *p = 1;
  new (p) int;
</PRE>

<P><U>Possible resolution:</U></P>

<P>Change in 6.7.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.life#7">basic.life</A>] paragraph 7 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Before the lifetime of an object has started but after the storage
which the object will occupy has been allocated [ Footnote: ...] or,
after the lifetime of an object has ended and before the storage which
the object occupied is reused or released, any pointer
that <DEL>represents the address of the storage location where the
object will be or was located</DEL> <INS>points to the object</INS>
may be used but only in limited ways. For an object under construction
or destruction, see 11.9.5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.cdtor">class.cdtor</A>].  Otherwise, such a
pointer refers to allocated storage (6.7.6.5.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/basic.stc.dynamic.allocation">basic.stc.dynamic.allocation</A>]),
and using the pointer as if the pointer were of type void* is
well-defined. Indirection through such a pointer is permitted but the
resulting lvalue may only be used in limited ways, as described
below. The program has undefined behavior if
<UL>
<LI>the pointer is used as the operand of a <I>delete-expression</I>,</LI>
<LI>the pointer is used to access a non-static data member or call a
non-static member function of the object, <DEL>or</DEL>
</LI>
<LI>the pointer is <DEL>implicitly</DEL> converted
(7.3.12 [<A href="https://wg21.link/conv.ptr">conv.ptr</A>]<INS>, 7.6.1.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.static.cast">expr.static.cast</A>]</INS>)
to a pointer to a virtual base class, or</LI>
<LI class="del">the pointer is used as the operand of a static_cast
(7.6.1.9 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.static.cast">expr.static.cast</A>]), except when the conversion is to
pointer to cv void, or to pointer to cv void and subsequently to
pointer to cv char, cv unsigned char, or cv std::byte
(17.2.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/cstddef.syn">cstddef.syn</A>]), or</LI>
<LI>the pointer is used as the operand of a dynamic_cast
(7.6.1.7 [<A href="https://wg21.link/expr.dynamic.cast">expr.dynamic.cast</A>]).</LI>
</UL>
